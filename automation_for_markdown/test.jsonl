[{"role": "user", "content": "I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

These changes can include variations in conductivity, permittivity, and permeability of the medium, such as when radio waves move from one material to another, or when encountering obstacles and irregularities in the propagation environment.\n\nScattering is a crucial phenomenon to consider for several reasons:\n\n- **Maintaining Signal Strength**: In many cases, scattering acts to mitigate signal strength loss. Without scattering, signals would primarily propagate in a straight line through the medium, making it difficult for radio waves to reach their intended target if an obstacle were in the direct path.\n\n- **Multipath Propagation**: Scattering introduces multipath propagation, where different signal paths with varying lengths and phases may interfere constructively or destructively at the receiver. This phenomenon significantly impacts the transmission and reception of signals in wireless communications systems.\n\n- **Non-line-of-Sight (NLOS) Scenarios**: In NLOS scenarios, where there is no direct line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver, scattering can facilitate indirect signal propagation through diffraction, reflection, and scattering off of various objects in the environment.\n\n- **Frequency Dependence**: The extent of scattering is often frequency-dependent. Different frequency components of a signal will scatter to varying degrees in the medium, leading to frequency selective fading, which is a key concern when designing wireless systems.\n\n- **Channel Models and Performance Prediction**: To accurately model and predict the performance of radio links, such as in link-level simulators like Sionna, including scattering, is essential. Effective channel models account for both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS scenarios, including scattering in their formulation to provide realistic channel conditions for simulations.\n\nIn Sionna, a deep learning and signal processing library for communication systems, link-level simulation is demonstrated using their `OFDMChannel` and `CDL` methods. These classes provide the structure necessary to create channel outputs of varying scattering conditions, which can then be used as input into models for accurate prediction of signal behavior in realistic propagation environments.\n\nTo leverage the Sionna library for simulations that account for scattering:\n\n1. The `OFDMChannel` simulation component can be configured with properties like `num_tx`, `num_rx`, and `carrier_frequency`, which are central to simulating realistic scattering conditions.\n  \n2. Physical-layer transmission models, as mentioned in the context, enable one to gain insights into the effects of scattering on communication system performance.\n\nGiven this understanding, the application of Sionna's tools allows modeling and analysis of practical scenarios, where scattering plays a pivotal role in the behavior of radio wave propagation. For more involved simulations, more advanced features that can be integrated into a Sionna setup include scattering effects like those found in Section \u201cScattering among objects\u201d in [.] Sionna. HTML, JSON (as JSONL), or TFRecord (or a custom file format that suits the user\u2019s context).\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nIn the context of radio wave propagation, scattering refers to the phenomenon where radio waves are diffused or scattered in many directions after interacting with irregularities in the propagation medium or with objects of various sizes (smaller or comparable to the wavelength of the radio waves) within the environment, such as rough surfaces, edges, and particles. This is distinct from reflection, where waves bounce off surfaces at predictable angles.\n\nScattering is crucial to consider in radio wave propagation for several reasons:\n\n1. **Signal Coverage**: Scattering can extend the coverage of radio signals to areas where line-of-sight (LoS) or direct paths are not available, such as behind obstacles or within complex environments like urban canyons. This is especially relevant at high frequencies where radio waves do not diffract around obstacles easily.\n\n2. **Impact on Signal Strength**: The process of scattering can cause the loss of signal power, as the radio waves are redistributed in various directions, and only a fraction of the power will reach the receiver.\n\n3. **Channel Modeling**: Understanding and accounting for scattering is essential in accurate channel modeling, which is critical for designing reliable communication systems. Accurate channel models help predict the performance of a communication system under various environmental conditions.\n\n4. **Fading Effects**: Scattering contributes to multipath propagation, leading to fast fading effects where the signal amplitude fluctuates rapidly due to the constructive and destructive interference of the scattered waves. This can have a significant impact on the quality of the received signal, and algorithms need to mitigate this for effective communication.\n\n5. **Higher Frequency Bands**: With the expansion of communication systems into higher-frequency bands such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz), scattering becomes more pronounced due to the smaller wavelengths. Surfaces that may appear smooth at lower frequencies can cause significant scattering at higher frequencies.\n\nFrom the given context, which includes references to a tutorial involving ray tracing experiments with the Sionna RT API, it's clear that scattering is an important consideration in the simulation and understanding of how radio waves propagate through various environments. The tutorial elaborates on how scattering can be modeled and its effects visualized, for example, by showing coverage maps that indicate how radio signals might distribute in an area with many scattering surfaces.\n\nFurther, the tutorial demonstrates how to set up ray tracing simulations and analyze the scattering effects in channel impulse responses, which represent the channel's response over time to a short burst of energy and include information about the power delay profile of a multipath channel.\n\nIn summary, scattering is a fundamental concept in radio wave propagation that needs to be factored into the design and analysis of communication systems, especially at higher frequencies where its effects are more prominent.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line. The format is like: Total Score: . Remember to seperate response line 1 and line 2 with only one \n!\n- The individual scores for each dimension on the second line, clearly indicated as integers.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

First, set up the MIMO system's parameters, create a CDL-5G channel model instance, and initialize the necessary layers. Then, combine these components to implement a MIMO transceiver with multi-stream transmission capabilities.\n\nHere below, you will find the required code organized into steps for the implementation. This code is supported by context gleaned from the given as well as experience with Sionna library:\n\n### Step 1: Configure MIMO System Parameters\n```python\nnum_tx_antennas = 64 # Number of transmit antennas\nnum_rx_antennas = 8 # Number of receive antennas\nnum_rx = 3 # Number of receivers\nnum_streams_per_user = 2 # Number of data streams per user\n```\n\n### Step 2: Instantiate a CDL-5G Channel Model\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import CDL\n\n# Instantiate a CDL-5G channel model\ncdl_model = 'CDL-D' # or other desired CDL model\ncarrier_frequency = 3.6e+9 # 3.6 GHz, for instance\n\ncdl_5g = CDL(model=cdl_model,\n             carrier_frequency=carrier_frequency,\n             num_rx=num_rx,\n             num_streams_per_tx=num_streams_per_user,\n             **other cd5_5g parameters you might use)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create MIMO Layers\n```python\nfrom sionna.mimo import SpatialMixer, SpatialDemixer\n\n# Customize the following layers as per your needs\nmimo_mixer = SpatialMixer(num_tx=num_rx,\n                          num_tx_antennas_per_stream=1,\n                          num_rx_antennas=num_rx_antennas,\n                          num_streams_per_rx=1)\nspatial_demixer = SpatialDemixer(mimo_mixer)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create a Pilot Generator and Estimator\n```python\nfrom sionna.ofdm import PilotGenerator, PilotLeastSquaresChannelEstimator\n\n# Other parameters come from the context\npilot_ofdm = PilotGenerator(**cdl_5g.pulse_shape_ofdm, \n                            pilot_symbol=..., \n                            num_data_ofdm_symbols_per_ofdm_symbol=...)\n\npilot_ls_channel_estimator = PilotLeastSquaresChannelEstimator(pilot_ofdm)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Simulate Transmissions\n```python\nsim = cdl_5g.simulate(..., # parameters for simulation\n                      mimo_mixer=mimo_mixer,\n                       # and rest of the optional parameters required)\n```\nMake sure to explore and fill in the parameters from the context as per the pattern this illustration conveys.\n\n### Additional Configuration\nRemember that to automate any process incrementally, you should consider writing Python functions or classes that encapsulate each step in the process. This not only keeps the code clean and maintainable but also allows you to configure different transmission scenarios easily. For instance:\n\n- Create channels for link by link Rayleigh multipath fading\n- Generate and transmit a sequence of pilot symbols and decode channel estimates\n- Simulate data transmissions\n\n### Analysis\nCapture the main outcomes, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) figures, per-stream channel hardening, and crosstalk during data transmissions to validate and analyze the simulated MIMO system's performance.\n\nAll these steps involve Sionna class and function calls, which you should refer to directly from the [Sionna documentation](http://sionna.rtfd.io).\n\nPlease note that the code examples are not fully fleshed out due to the nature of the prompt's requirement to avoid any laziness. For a full, working machine-learning implementation, more details about the particular intended use (e.g., framework versions, additional settings) would need to be provided to enable a complete, end-to-end solution.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo implement multiple data stream transmissions in a MIMO setup using Sionna, you'll need to follow several steps that involve creating a simulation environment similar to what's suggested in the context provided. The instructions below outline the process you should take, making reference only to the necessary code elements from the context.\n\n1. **Prepare the Environment:**\n   - Import necessary modules from TensorFlow and Sionna.\n   - Configure the GPU settings if you plan to run the simulation on a GPU for faster computations.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   import sionna\n   # ... (other necessary imports)\n   ```\n   \n2. **Set Up System Parameters:**\n   - Define parameters for the simulation, such as the number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver, modulation order, subcarrier spacing, and any specific configurations for the MIMO OFDM setup.\n\n3. **Create Channel Model:**\n   - Instantiate the 3GPP 38.901 CDL channel models, with the required number of clusters, rays, and angle spread parameters that follow your use case.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.channel.tr38901 import CDL\n   # Example instantiation:\n   # cdl = CDL(\"CDL-C\", num_clusters=10, num_rays_per_cluster=20, ... )\n   ```\n\n4. **Generate Data Streams:**\n   - Use a binary source to generate the data for multiple streams.\n   - Encode the data using an LDPC encoder.\n   - Map the encoded bits to symbols using a QAM Mapper pertained to your modulation order.\n\n5. **Resource Grid and Pilot Pattern Configuration:**\n   - Create an OFDM resource grid and define a pilot pattern.\n   - Employ resource grid mapper to map the data and pilots to the grid.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.ofdm import ResourceGrid, ResourceGridMapper\n   # Example instantiation:\n   # resource_grid = ResourceGrid(...)\n   # resource_grid_mapper = ResourceGridMapper(...)\n   ```\n\n6. **Precoding and MIMO Processing:**\n   - Implement precoding, such as ZF Precoding which requires perfect CSI. Alternatively, explore other precoding techniques available in Sionna if your simulation accounts for imperfect CSI.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.ofdm import ZFPrecoder\n   # Example instantiation:\n   # precoder = ZFPrecoder(...)\n   ```\n\n7. **Simulating Data Transmission:**\n   - Combine the precoded symbols with the OFDM Modulator to generate the OFDM symbols for transmission.\n   - Transmit the symbols through the CDL channel model.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.ofdm import OFDMModulator\n   # Example instantiation:\n   # ofdm_mod = OFDMModulator(...)\n   ```\n\n8. **Channel Estimation and Equalization:**\n   - At the receiver end, use a channel estimator such as the Least Squares (LS) estimator, and interpolate the channel using the nearest-neighbor method.\n\n   ```python\n   from sionna.ofdm import LSChannelEstimator\n   # Example instantiation:\n   # ls_estimator = LSChannelEstimator(...)\n   ```\n\n   - Employ a MIMO equalizer, such as LMMSE, to retrieve the transmitted symbols.\n\n9. **Demodulation and Decoding:**\n   - Demodulate the received symbols using an OFDM Demodulator.\n   - Demap the QAM symbols back to bits.\n   - Decode the bits using the LDPC decoder.\n\n10. **Performance Evaluation:**\n    - Compute performance metrics such as the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER).\n    - Run the simulation over a range of SNR values to evaluate the error rates.\n\n    ```python\n    from sionna.utils import compute_ber, sim_ber\n    # Example performance evaluation:\n    # ber, bler = sim_ber(...)\n    ```\n\n11. **Visualizing Results:**\n    - Use plotting libraries (e.g., matplotlib) to visualize the BLER or BER performance of the MIMO system under various channel conditions and configurations.\n\nThroughout these steps, you need to tailor the configuration of each component to your specific MIMO system requirements. The context provided includes examples of setting up simulations for evaluating the impact of insufficient cyclic prefix length and shows how to load results, run simulations, and visualize outcomes. Use this as a guide and incorporate the stream management routines from Sionna to handle multiple data streams in your MIMO setup.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity. This further justifies a relatively low score within the limited correctness level.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not entirely incorrect (meriting 1 point) but contains limited correct information relative to the overall content.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

It seems the model and names are derived from a specific code structure provided by `plot_ber._n0_db_values()` and other utility functions like `_eb_n0_db()` which are not standard class and method names from Keras and Sionna.\n\nThe model above is a simplified version and would typically be expanded to include all the necessary components, such as optimizers, loss functions, training routines, and evaluation metrics if you intend to train the system. However, as the context specifies that the focus is on the BER simulation aspect utilizing the `LDPC_QAM_AWGN` class, this model suffices with the given information.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo implement a Keras model for channel coding BER simulations using the `LDPC_QAM_AWGN` class provided in the Sionna package, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the GPU configuration**:\n\nMake sure that the notebook is configured to use the appropriate GPU and that TensorFlow is set up to allocate only as much memory as needed. If you have a GPU configured, set TensorFlow's memory growth to prevent it from consuming all available GPU memory upfront.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\n2. **Import the necessary components from Sionna**:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.mapping import Mapper, Demapper\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc import LDPC5GEncoder, LDPC5GDecoder\nfrom sionna.channel import AWGN\nfrom sionna.utils import BinarySource, ebnodb2no\n```\n\n3. **Define your `LDPC_QAM_AWGN` class**:\n\nThe `LDPC_QAM_AWGN` class captures the entire communication system including encoding, modulation, the AWGN channel effect, demodulation, and decoding.\n\nWhen you define the `LDPC_QAM_AWGN` class (as given in your context), ensure that you set up member components like the mapper, channel, encoder, decoder, etc., in the class's `__init__` method.\n\n4. **Implement the call method within your model**:\n\nThis method should take in the batch size and the signal-to-noise ratio (Eb/N0) and perform the following steps:\n\n- Generate binary data with the `BinarySource`.\n- (Optional based on configuration) Encode the data using the `LDPC5GEncoder`.\n- Map the binary or coded data onto QAM symbols using the `Mapper`.\n- Pass the mapped symbols through the `AWGN` channel.\n- Demap the received symbols in the presence of noise using the `Demapper`.\n- (Optional based on configuration) Apply a scrambler if needed.\n- Decode the LLRs (log-likelihood ratios) using `LDPC5GDecoder`.\n\n5. **Instantiate the model**:\n\nCreate an instance of your `LDPC_QAM_AWGN` class. You need to specify parameters such as the number of information bits (k), the codeword length (n), and the number of bits per QAM symbol (num_bits_per_symbol). If you wish to use the all-zero codeword, set `use_allzero=True`. To include the scrambler in the simulation, set `use_scrambler=True`.\n\n```python\nmodel = LDPC_QAM_AWGN(k, n, num_bits_per_symbol, \n                      use_allzero=True, use_scrambler=True)\n```\n\n6. **Simulate the BER performance**:\n\nRun Monte Carlo simulations by passing different Eb/N0 values to the model to obtain the BER performance. You can use utility functions like `ber_plot_allzero16qam.simulate()` to automate the simulations, as shown in the context, and analyze the BER under the different conditions specified.\n\n7. **Visualize results**:\n\nAfter running the simulations, you can visualize the BER vs. Eb/N0 curve to understand the performance of the communication system. Make sure that you compare the performance of your all-zero codeword model with and without scrambling (and potentially with other configurations) to validate the accuracy of simulations.\n\nRemember to always review Sionna's documentation or example notebooks for more information and guidance on utilizing their package optimally.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points.

When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior.

Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level.

This would typically involve understanding the material characteristics of wood, which contribute to the interaction between impinging electromagnetic waves and a solid wedge made of wood.\n\nWithout additional instructions or specific information on wedge materials such as wood, I can only provide a high-level explanation. The concept of diffraction for wedges made of different materials is generally based on the permittivity and permeability of the materials, which influence the electric and magnetic properties respectively. Higher permittivity could cause more significant reflection and refraction, while higher permeability may attenuate the wave more. Obviously, the structure and density of the material also play a role.\n\nThe change in path gain, which relates to the power of the reflected signals, would be influenced by these material properties. For example, a wedge made of conductive material might result in more of the incident signal being absorbed and transformed into free electrons, thus decreasing the reflected power and lowering the path gain. On the other hand, a material with higher permittivity might act more like a mirror, leading to a strong reflection and consequently an increase in path gain.\n\nTo accurately interpret changes in path gain due to different materials, one would typically use a mathematical model to compare measurements for different materials and analyze the result. This would likely involve calculating the amplitude and phase change in the reflected paths and determine the overall path gain.\n\nUnfortunately, without specifics or an experimental setup including actual material properties and test results regarding wood or other materials used in the context of the Sionna simulator, I am unable to provide a detailed explanation or a numerical interpretation. So, while the behavior of diffraction in different wedge materials would undoubtedly influence the path gain, the details required to make such an interpretation are not available in the given context.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo examine the behavior of diffraction with different materials, such as wood, for the wedge, you would need to consider the material\u2019s electrical properties and how they influence diffraction. The key property affecting diffraction is the permittivity of the material, which determines how the electromagnetic wave interacts with the material.\n\nIn the context provided, Sionna RT is configured to perform ray tracing experiments with diffraction taken into account. As part of the tutorial, the code contains provisions for changing the material of the wedge and observing the resulting changes in the channel impulse response and path gain.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to interpret the change in path gain when using different materials like wood for the wedge:\n\n1. **Understanding Path Gain**: Path gain indicates how much of the signal's power is preserved as the wave travels along a path. If the material of the wedge is changed from a perfect conductor (like metal) to a non-perfect conductor (like wood), the reflection and diffraction characteristics would alter accordingly. For an almost perfect conductor, the reflected waves are usually strong; however, with materials like wood, reflected power can decrease due to absorption and less reflective properties. \n\n2. **Changing the Material in the Code**: Within the tutorial context, the material of the wedge is initially set to metal, an almost perfect reflector, using the code:\n\n    ```python\n    scene.objects[\"wedge\"].radio_material = \"itu_metal\"\n    ```\n\n   To study wood's impact on diffraction, you would change the material of the wedge to wood using:\n\n    ```python\n    scene.objects[\"wedge\"].radio_material = \"itu_wood\"\n    ```\n\n    The behavior of the wood material is predefined in Sionna's Radio Materials library, with \"itu_wood\" being an identifier for the specific electrical properties of wood as per ITU models.\n\n3. **Recomputing the Paths**: After changing the material, you need to recompute the paths to include the effects of the new material. This is done by calling `scene.compute_paths()` again.\n\n4. **Analyzing Results**: Once recomputed, you can analyze the channel impulse response which contains information about all paths, including those affected by diffraction. The resulting gains of various paths (line-of-sight, reflected, and diffracted) could be compared to see the impact of substituting a perfect reflector with wood.\n\n5. **Observing Differences**: You should expect to see a reduced reflected path gain for non-perfect conductors compared to metals. The continuity of the total field across the RSB and ISB boundaries should still be retained due to the heuristic extensions implemented in the Sionna RT simulations, which extend diffracted field equations to non-perfect conductors.\n\n6. **Visual Inspection**: Utilize the plotting functions from the tutorial to visualize the impact on the path gain. These visuals will show the variations in gain for the total, line-of-sight, reflected, and diffracted paths at different angles around the wedge.\n\nBy undertaking these steps, one can interpret how changing the wedge to a material like wood affects the behavior of diffraction in the simulation. It\u2019s important to note the balance between these propagation pathways can drastically alter the path gain and ultimately, the performance of the communication channel.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

You can define the layout, create materials, and add/position objects within the environment.\n\n2. **Define the Camera Position:**\nSet the viewpoint of the camera from which you will preview the scene. This is defined by pitch, yaw, and roll angles, as well as the elevation, azimuth, and distance from the target point in the scene.\n\n3. **Use the `preview()` Function:**\nOnce the scene and camera position are set up, you can call the `preview()` function to render the scene from the camera's perspective. The function is designed to be used within a Jupyter notebook and does not require any additional parameters. \n\n4. **View the Preview:**\nAfter you run the `preview()` function, the ray-traced scene will be shown as an interactive 3D model within your Jupyter notebook. You can interact with this model, such as rotating or zooming, to explore the scene as if in a 3D graphics environment.\n\n5. **Optional Enhancements:**\nThe `preview()` function supports additional features for enhancement, such as showing a grid or rendering hidden objects, which can be toggled via the Jupyter notebook UI after initialization.\n\nThis action may look like this in a Jupyter notebook:\n```python\n# Create a sample scene (the actual code would be more extensive and detailed)\nexample_scene = Scene()\n\n# Define the camera position of the preview\ncamera = Camera(cam_height=1.5,\n                zoom_fov_deg=40,\n                pos=[300, 100, 5],          # Example: Position of the camera\n                look_at=[100, 100, 1])       # Example: Where the camera is directed\n\n# Preview the scene with the camera position from above\nexample_scene.preview(camera)\n```\n\nThis outline illustrates how to use the `preview()` function within a Jupyter notebook using Sionna to visualize a ray-traced scene. Make sure to have your environment set up correctly with Sionna installed, and the notebook must have the appropriate import statements to use the Sionna library and its `preview()` function.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo preview a ray-traced scene within a Jupyter notebook using the `preview()` function in Sionna, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Required Modules:**\n   First, you need to import necessary modules from Sionna that you will need to create and work with a scene.\n\n2. **Load or Create a Scene:**\n   You can load an existing scene using `load_scene()` or create a custom one. Sionna provides example scenes that you can directly load, or you can build your own using OpenStreetMap and Blender.\n\n3. **Configure Scene Elements:**\n   If you're building your scene, you'll need to configure different elements like transmitters, receivers, and antennas within the scene. This may involve specifying the position, orientation, and antenna parameters for transmitters and receivers.\n\n4. **Preview the Scene:**\n   Once your scene is configured, you can call the `preview()` method on the `Scene` object to visualize the ray-traced scene directly within your Jupyter notebook. This will give you an immediate sense of the scene layout and propagation environment before you proceed with any further computations or analysis.\n\n5. **Interpret the Preview:**\n   The preview will typically display the 3D geometry of the scene and may include visual indications of the transmitters and receivers. Use this visual feedback to verify that the scene is set up correctly and make any adjustments as needed.\n\nHere is an abstracted example of how you might use the `preview()` function in a Jupyter notebook, omitting specific setup details which depend on your particular scenario:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: import modules (specific imports depend on the scene's requirements)\nimport sionna\nfrom sionna.rt import Scene, load_scene\n\n# Step 2: Load an existing scene or create a new one\nscene = load_scene(\"your_scene_here\")  # Replace \"your_scene_here\" with the actual scene name or path\n\n# (Optional) Steps involving scene configuration if creating a new scene.\n# This might include adding transmitters, receivers, etc.\n\n# Step 4: Preview the scene within the Jupyter notebook\nscene.preview()\n```\n\nPlease note this is a high-level outline of the process. The actual code might differ based on the detailed requirements of your scene and the specific version of Sionna you are using. Always refer to the Sionna documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nExplain the support for both binary inputs and bipolar inputs in the Sionna discrete module.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nIn the Sionna discrete module, there is support for both binary inputs and bipolar inputs. This means that during digital modulation, both binary data streams (where each symbol can take on one of two values, typically `0` and `1`) and bipolar data streams (where each symbol is represented by two values, typically `-1` and `1`) can be used as input.\n\nThe concept of binary and bipolar is not specific to Sionna or any one software library\u2013it is a common notion in the field of digital communications. However, the practical implementation in Sionna for simulating communication systems allows one to work with these two types of data based on the specific needs of the modulation scheme or simulation.\n\nFor example, if you're working on simulating a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation scheme, you would use binary inputs because there are two possible phase states: `0` degrees and `180` degrees. On the other hand, for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which utilizes multiple phase and amplitude levels for coding information, bipolar inputs are necessary to represent a broader range of symbol states.\n\nThe specific support and handling of binary and bipolar inputs in the discrete module might involve the use of different Python data structures or range limits to accommodate the kind of input signal being modulated. It's paramount to understand and be able to manipulate these input types correctly when conducting simulations for different digital communication scenarios with Sionna's discrete module.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe Sionna discrete module supports both binary and bipolar input types for its channel models. When using binary inputs, the input values are expected to be in the set {0, 1}. Conversely, for bipolar inputs, the values are in the set {-1, 1}. In the case of bipolar inputs, it is assumed that a '0' from the binary set is mapped to '-1' in the bipolar set.\n\nThis dual support allows the user to work with either binary or bipolar inputs, depending on the requirements of the simulation or the communication system being modeled. It is important to note that the mapping of binary '0' to bipolar '-1' affects how the channel model interprets the input and consequently how it computes outputs such as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs).\n\nLLRs provide a measure of the channel transition probabilities, and they depend on the a priori probability of the inputs. The LLR calculation can be described as follows: \n\\[ L(y|X=1) = L(X=1|y) + L_a(X=1) \\]\nHere, \\( L_a(X=1) \\) is the logarithm of the ratio of probabilities that X equals 1 over X equals 0, which only depends on the a priori probability of X being 1.\n\nMoreover, the channel reliability parameter \\( p_b \\) can either be a scalar value or a tensor of any shape that can be broadcast to the input shape, facilitating efficient implementation of channels with non-uniform error probabilities.\n\nAdditionally, the channel models use the Gumbel-softmax trick to ensure differentiability of the model with respect to the channel reliability parameter. This trick is a gradient estimation technique that allows for the backpropagation of gradients through discrete variables, making it suitable for learning channel parameters.\n\nFinally, examples in the Sionna discrete module's documentation demonstrate how to set up and run simulations with binary symmetric channels. For instance, when initializing a BinarySymmetricChannel, users can specify whether the channel receives bipolar input and whether LLRs should be returned. An example initialization is provided:\n```python\nbsc = BinarySymmetricChannel(return_llrs=False, bipolar_input=False)\n```\nDuring the run phase, an input tensor `x` and bit flipping probability `pb` are passed to the initialized channel object to simulate channel behavior:\n```python\nx = tf.zeros((128,))  # x is the channel input\npb = 0.1  # pb is the bit flipping probability\ny = bsc((x, pb))\n```\nIn summary, the Sionna discrete module allows users to model channel behaviors with flexibility in input type and provides mechanisms for calculating LLRs, supporting both binary and bipolar inputs with the potential for custom channel reliability parameters.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

In wireless communications systems, OFDM is widely used for high-rate data transmission, especially over mobile and fixed broadband channels. OFDM achieves this by dividing the available spectrum into multiple, orthogonal subchannels, thus allowing for better spectral efficiency and mitigating the effects of multipath and delay spread.\n\nThe `OFDMModulator` class within Sionna is designed to simulate the process of modulating data for transmission over an OFDM-based communication link. In its fundamental operation, the `OFDMModulator` processes frequency-domain data on a resource grid, typically in the form as it would be after applying an `OFDMChannel` class, and converts this into a time-domain OFDM signal for transmission through the channel.\n\nWhen a signal needs to be transmitted over an OFDM channel, it is mapped onto the frequency-domain resource grid for each OFDM symbol (or time slot). This grid partitioning allows the signal to be transmitted in parallel across a set of orthogonal subcarriers.\n\nThe incoming resource grid will include the amplitude and phase information for each subcarrier of the OFDM signal for every time slot it will occupy. The `OFDMModulator` class's main role is to process this frequency-domain resource grid as an input, aggregate the subcarriers into an OFDM symbol sequence, and then perform an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). This IFFT operation converts the signal from the frequency domain back to the time domain, ensuring it is ready for transmission across the physical medium.\n\nThe IFFT size (typically determined by the number of subcarriers) is often longer than the length of the symbol interval, which is a key characteristic of the OFDM technique. It is this inherent cyclic prefix in OFDM transmission that guards against intersymbol interference due to multipath propagation. After the IFFT, this cyclic prefix is appended to the OFDM symbol to form the complete OFDM time-domain signal. The signal is then ready for subsequent analog processing and transmission over the channel.\n\nThis class is best understood with code examples from the context provided, such as sample code not given in the response but trailing from the `OFDMModulator` context to the `OFDMChannel` and eventually to prototyping the entire end-to-end communication system with bits-to-PDF or indistinguishable samples to demodulated bits and verifying that the SNR is observed in the error rate. However, without those codes being shared and since the explanation provided here does not have the explanatory benefit of these visual aids, the narrative description in the context provided would have to suffice as per the context policy.\n\nIt is important to note that the `OFDMModulator` is just one part of a complete simulation pipeline within Sionna, where bits are modulated into a symbol sequence, which is then processed to become a frequency-domain resource grid, and finally turned into a time-domain signal. Understanding and utilizing the `OFDMModulator` and other components correctly are crucial to accurately simulate and analyze OFDM-based communication systems, which is an active area of academic and industrial research.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe `OFDMModulator` class plays a crucial role in Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Its primary function is to convert a frequency domain resource grid into a time-domain OFDM signal, which is suitable for transmission over a physical medium such as a wireless channel.\n\nWhen a `ResourceGrid` is created, it defines the mapping of data and pilot symbols onto a sequence of OFDM symbols given a specific Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size. The resource grid also accounts for guard and DC carriers by nulling them. In terms of cellular network standards like 4G and 5G, a `ResourceGrid` would correspond to what is known as a slot.\n\nBefore modulation, the `ResourceGridMapper` is employed to map a tensor of complex-valued data symbols onto the resource grid. Once this mapping is complete, the `OFDMModulator` is utilized to convert this mapped grid into a time-domain signal that incorporates an optional cyclic prefix.\n\nThe `OFDMModulator` class is instantiated with a parameter, `cyclic_prefix_length`, which specifies the length of the cyclic prefix to be prepended to each OFDM symbol. The cyclic prefix is a duplicated segment of the OFDM symbol that is placed at the beginning of each symbol. This cyclic prefix serves to mitigate inter-symbol interference caused by multipath propagation in a wireless environment. However, it is important that the length of the cyclic prefix does not exceed the FFT size.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the input and output expectations for the `OFDMModulator` class, as described in the context provided:\n\n- Input: A resource grid in the frequency domain, which is represented as a tensor with the dimensions `[..., num_ofdm_symbols, fft_size]` in the `tf.complex` data type. Each element within the tensor corresponds to a complex-valued data symbol that has been mapped onto the frequency-domain grid.\n  \n- Output: A time-domain OFDM signal, which is a tensor with dimensions `[..., num_ofdm_symbols*(fft_size+cyclic_prefix_length)]` in the `tf.complex` data type. This tensor represents the modulated OFDM symbols ready for transmission, with each symbol extended by the length of the cyclic prefix.\n\nIn essence, the `OFDMModulator` performs an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) operation on the frequency-domain resource grid, and then appends the cyclic prefix to each OFDM symbol. This results in a time-domain signal that is ready to be sent over a wireless channel, where the properties of OFDM, such as resistance to frequency-selective fading and efficient use of bandwidth, can be fully exploited.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

The package may also provide models for optical amplifiers, such as erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs).\n\n   - For instance, to set up an EDFA, you can use the `Amplifier` class with appropriate configurations:\n   \n   ```python\n   // Define EDFA parameters\n   gain = 16                  # Amplifier gain in dB\n   gsa = 2.5                  # Spontaneous emission factor\n   nf = gsa / (np.power(10, gain / 10) - 1)  # Noise figure\n\n   // Instantiate an EDFA object\n   edfa = sn.optical.Amplifier(fiber, gain=gain, nf=nf)\n   ```\n\n4. **Simulate Signal Propagation through the Lumped Amplified Optical Channel**:\n   Use the defined models to simulate the behavior of the optical channel over the transmitted signal. This would involve coding the steps of the signal propagation, such as modulation, signal transmission through the fiber, and amplification through the amplifier.\n\n   - An example code snippet that could be part of this simulation is as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   // Simulate signal transmission over a set of fiber spans\n   num_spans = 10            # Number of spans to simulate\n   gp = nf / np.sqrt(g + 1)  # Amplifier noise figure\n\n   // Re-usable channel model\n   transtation_model = sn.communications.QAM(4).mapping()\n   demodulation_model= sn.communications.QAM(4).demapping(approximate=\"sphere\")\n   channel = sn.model.ChannelModel(fiber, [span_length] * num_spans, heterodyne=True)\n\n   // Simulate the channel response and apply the channel to the signal\n   y_k, snr_out = channel([x_k])\n   y = x_k * channel_frequencies\n\n   // Signal amplification through an EDFA\n   a = sn.model.RFTransistorGate(\n       gampla,\n       [num_spans],\n       fmax=0.0,\n       bass_gain=-6.5,\n       kfbk=30, # 30 dB feed-back attenuation\n       kmxi=0.0,\n       kmxo=30.0,\n       vc=.4)\n   y = a(y, n)\n   ```\n\n5. **Analyze and/or Visualize the Results**:\n   After simulating the optical channel, you can analyze the performance of the system. For a simple setup, a useful performance metric might be the bit error rate (BER), which could be computed using a BER calculator provided by the Sionna library.\n\nNote that the above code snippets are high-level and are just snippets from the available resources like the Sionna Optical Communications Tutorial. They do not run as complete code by themselves, but should be used and combined in a script for the respective optical simulations while considering your design's specific parameters, data rates, and bitward and forward error correction (BW-FEC) schemes.\n\nTo delve deeper and ensure accuracy, it's imperative to refer to the official [Sionna documentation](https://intelligent-networks.cispa.saarland/sionna/index.html) and study the provided tutorials, especially the [\"Optical Communications\"](https://intelligent-networks.cispa.saarland/sionna/renderer/optical_channel_emulator.html) tutorial, which would offer detailed examples and guidance in simulating a lumped amplification optical channel effectively.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo simulate a lumped amplification optical channel using the Sionna Python package, follow these general steps, referencing the given context for more detailed code examples where helpful:\n\n1. **Setup the Environment:**\n   Begin by configuring your Python environment to use Sionna. Import required packages including Sionna, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib for visualization purposes. If Sionna is not installed, you need to install it first.\n\n2. **Parameter Initialization:**\n   Define your simulation parameters such as the simulation time window (`t_sim`), the number of simulation samples (`n_sim`), and the impulse parameters like peak power (`p_0`) and pulse duration (`t_0`). Also, define your channel parameters like the number of spans (`n_span`). Initialize the time and frequency vectors using the `sionna.channel.utils.time_frequency_vector()` function.\n\n3. **Impulse Generation:**\n   Create your Gaussian impulse signal using the equation provided in the context, with `t` being the time vector and `p_0` and `t_0` as defined parameters.\n\n4. **Configure the Channel:**\n   You need to normalize units for your simulation, so decide on time and distance normalization factors. Define fiber parameters such as carrier frequency (`f_c`), fiber span length (`length_sp`), and fiber attenuation (`alpha`). For Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA), specify the amplifier gain (`g_edfa`) and noise figure (`f_edfa`). \n\n5. **Instantiate Channel Components:**\n   Create instances of the `SSFM` layer (Single Span Fiber Model) representing spans of the optical fiber and the `EDFA` representing the amplifiers. When creating the `SSFM` instance, decide if you want to enable or disable various impairments such as amplification, attenuation, dispersion, and nonlinearity. In the given context, everything but attenuation is disabled for the initial experiment.\n\n6. **Define the Lumped Amplification Channel:**\n   Create a function `lumped_amplification_channel` (as shown in the context) that takes in an input signal and sequentially propagates it through each fiber span and amplifier. This typically involves a loop where each iteration represents propagation through one span and one amplifier.\n\n7. **Simulate the Signal Transmission:**\n   Send the created Gaussian impulse through the lumped amplification channel by calling the function with your impulse as an argument to get the output signal. Here, the input signal `x` represents the Gaussian impulse to be transmitted, and `y` is the received signal after channel propagation.\n\n8. **Visualize the Results:**\n   Generate spectral representations of the transmitted and received signals and plot these alongside their time-domain presentations to analyze the effects of the channel. Use Matplotlib for plotting the comparison between the transmitted pulse and the received pulse in both time and frequency domains.\n\n9. **Analyze the Output:**\n   Assess the noise introduced by the amplifiers and the compensation of attenuation by comparing the transmitted (`x`) and received (`y`) signals. The simulation context will show whether attenuation has been completely compensated and if any significant noise is visible.\n\nThese steps provide a framework for the Sionna-based simulation of an optical communication channel. Actual implementations may require fine-tuning of the simulation parameters and additional considerations depending on the specific objectives of the simulation study.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

[{"role": "user", "content": "I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

Below is an outline that includes package imports and GPU configuration specific to the task, written with markdown for readability.\n\n1. **Check your system's GPU configuration** (`nvidia-smi`). This step is not typically included in your notebook code but is useful for ensuring you have the necessary GPU and drivers installed and that you are not exceeding your allocated GPU memory.\n\n2. **Import the necessary Python packages for the Sionna setup**:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   import numpy as np\n   from tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision import experimental as prec\n   ```\n   \n   You might also need to import `LDPC5GEncoder`, `LDPC5GDecoder`, and `LDPC5GDecoderMPC` classes if they are not already imported.\n\n3. **Configure Tensorflow to utilize a specific GPU**. In this provided context, you've been given the code that checks and uses GPU number 0. If a GPU is found, it will be configured to limit the GPU memory growth. Here is the code:\n\n   ```python\n   # If number of gpus is at least 1, take the first one (should probably used another strategy on a multi-gpu system)\n   gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n   if gpus:\n       try:\n           if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda():\n               # Memory Growing\n               for gpu in gpus:\n                   tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)\n               if len(gpus) > 1: \n                  print(f\"Using GPU: {gpus} (Parallel Access)\")\n               else:\n                  print(f\"Using GPU: {gpus}\")\n               tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(gpus[0], [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=25000)])\n               logical_protected = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')[0]\n           else:\n               raise Exception(\"Executed without GPU or GPU support is disabled for TensorFlow\")\n       except RuntimeError as e:\n           print(e)\n   else:\n       raise Exception(\"Executed on a machine with no GPUs.\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Establish mixed precision for enhanced performance**: Concerning the marked line from your context:\n \n   ```python\n   prec.set_policy('mixed_float16')  # Enable mixed precision\n   ```\n\n   Mixed precision can yield increased computational performance, especially on newer GPUs. It is a careful balance between using lower precision (which provides a speedup) and ensuring that the model's accuracy and convergence are retained.\n\n5. **Implement the Weighted BP algorithm on the specific 5G LDPC codes**. Once your simulation is set up with a GPU model, mixed precision, and supports the necessary imports, you can proceed with the Weighted BP algorithm for 5G LDPC codes. Detailed instructions for that part should be provided in the Sionna source code or documentation, or will follow from your specific use case.\n\nTo specifically perform the decoding with the Weighted BP algorithm after the previous setup, you would use the relevant class as shown in the code block you've already provided, only ensuring you\u2019ve replaced `LDPC5GDecoder` with `WeightedBPDecoder` after a proper class definition is in place:\n\n```python\n# LDPC5G 5/6 Decoder setup\nldpce5g_decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(num_iter=m, decoder_type='bp', save_input_metrics=True) # Here you'd replace with a weighted BP decoder, once available\n```\n\nFrom the context, it seems that the `WeightedBPDecoder` is still under development, but when ready, it would be used similarly to other decoders, keeping in mind any specific input parameters or configuration necessary for the Weighted BP algorithm.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo set up a simulation environment in Sionna, specifically for simulating the Weighted Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm for decoding 5G Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, you\u2019ll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration**: Before starting, you will have to configure the Python environment to use the GPU for computations, as Sionna uses TensorFlow as its backend which can leverage GPU acceleration.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    import tensorflow as tf\n\n    # Specify the GPU to use or \"\" to use the CPU\n    gpu_num = 0\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n\n    # Configure TensorFlow to only allocate memory as needed on the GPU\n    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n    if gpus:\n        try:\n            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n        except RuntimeError as e:\n            print(e)\n\n    # Set TensorFlow logger to ERROR to avoid less severe warnings\n    tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n    ```\n\n2. **Package Imports**: Import necessary Sionna packages and other Python libraries:\n\n    ```python\n    # Import Sionna package\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n        \n    # Import additional required components from Sionna\n    from sionna.fec.ldpc import LDPCBPDecoder, LDPC5GEncoder, LDPC5GDecoder\n    from sionna.utils.metrics import BitwiseMutualInformation\n    from sionna.fec.utils import GaussianPriorSource, load_parity_check_examples\n    from sionna.utils import ebnodb2no, hard_decisions\n    from sionna.utils.metrics import compute_ber\n    from sionna.utils.plotting import PlotBER\n    from tensorflow.keras.losses import BinaryCrossentropy\n    ```\n\n3. **Simulation Environment**: To simulate the LDPC codes, a `WeightedBP5G` class derived from `tf.keras.Model` must be set up. This class will encapsulate the components and logic for Weighted BP on 5G LDPC codes, including a `GaussianPriorSource` for generating Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs), and the `LDPC5GDecoder` initialized with trainable weights.\n\n    ```python\n    class WeightedBP5G(tf.keras.Model):\n        def __init__(self, k, n, num_iter=20):\n            super().__init__()\n            self.encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n            self.decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(self.encoder,\n                                         num_iter=1,\n                                         stateful=True,\n                                         hard_out=False,\n                                         cn_type=\"boxplus\",\n                                         trainable=True)\n            self.llr_source = GaussianPriorSource()\n            self._num_iter = num_iter\n            self._coderate = k/n\n            self._bce = BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n\n        def call(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n            # Code omitted for brevity\n    ```\n\n    Please note that within the `WeightedBP5G` class's `call` function, the forward pass logic and learning process should be implemented as specified in the provided context information.\n\n4. **Instantiate and Train Model**: Create an instance of the `WeightedBP5G` class and run a simulation to analyze performance before and after training.\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    %matplotlib inline\n\n    # Instantiate the simulation model for 5G LDPC codes with the Weighted BP algorithm\n    num_iter = 10\n    k = 400  # Number of information bits per codeword\n    n = 800  # Codeword length\n    model5G = WeightedBP5G(k, n, num_iter=num_iter)\n\n    # Perform subsequent training and simulations as directed by the context\n    # Any training loop or simulation runs must be implemented here as per the instructions in the context, with optimizers, metrics, etc.\n    ```\n\nEnsure to use the code snippets and adjust the parameters according to the specific requirements of your simulation environment and tasks.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

[{"role": "user", "content": "I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process.

Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'.

The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

[{"role": "user", "content": "I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process.

Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process.

Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

[{"role": "user", "content": "I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer.

Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2.

You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance.

If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ...

Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

Here's an outline with the necessary code snippets to accomplish this task:\n\n1. **Creating a PlanarArray object:**\n   You will need to start by creating an instance of the `PlanarArray` class. Make sure to configure it according to your needs, specifying the number of antenna elements and the spacing between them, as shown in the context. Here is an example code from the context:\n   \n   ```python\n   num_elements = (10, 10) # 10 rows and 10 columns of antenna elements\n   element_spacing = frequency_of_operation / 2.76 # 1/2.76 lambda\n   antenna_array = PlanarArray(num_elements=num_elements,\n                               element_pattern='Dipole',\n                               polarization=['V'],\n                               polarization_mix=np.eye(1),\n                               element_spacing=element_spacing)\n   ```\n   \n2. **Method for changing the orientation:**\n   To change the orientation of the `PlanarArray`, you can use the method `pattern.rotate()` with the angles of rotation as arguments. This method will provide you with a rotated version of the plane where your antenna array lies, and consequently the visual representation of the array's pattern. The instance `antenna_array` can be rotated along the normalized axis by providing the corresponding angles in degrees (e.g., 45 degrees for theta):\n\n   ```python\n   rotated_theta = 45 # Rotate the plane by 45 degrees along theta\n   rotated_phi = 0 # No rotation along phi\n   rotated_antenna_array = antenna_array.pattern.rotate(rotated_theta, rotated_phi)\n   ```\n\n3. **Visualizing the rotated antenna array:**\n   After enabling rotation and obtaining the new rotated pattern, you may visualize the `PlanarArray` at the rotated positions by plotting the array pattern in both the xz and yz planes where the axes are defined respectively by \\([\\sin(\\phi), 0, \\cos(\\phi)]\\) and \\([\\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)), \\sin(\\theta), \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)]\\).\n\n   The following lines show an example of visualizing the pattern in 2D:\n\n   ```python\n   data1 = rotated_antenna_array(pattern_name=\"EF\", coordinate=\"Spherical\")\n   data2 = rotated_antenna_array(pattern_name=\"EF\", coordinate=\"UT\")\n   \n   plot_array_response_polar(data1, xz_plane=True)\n   plot_array_response_polar(data2, xz_plane=True)   \n   ```\n\nWhen executing the entire code sequence, you will be able to observe the new rotated antenna pattern that is appropriate for the \"White space between LTE band classes E-G in Europe\" scenario, as all methods of antenna arrays are based on the ejection of waves from the eutopoints by a stereographic projection.\n\nThe resulting 2D plots for the xz and yz planes will show the ef-field component of the antenna array within the main-plane coverage of the array. The structural characteristics of the plots include a main lobe and low-level side lobes as well as variations in gain. The generation of animation or exporting of data used for visualization is available if needed for further analysis or processing. \n\nThe complete rendered answer should follow the exact format as given here, maintaining ordering, indentation, code blocks, and markdown headings.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe provided context does not specifically include information about methods for changing antenna orientations in Sionna's `PlanarArray`. However, typically in antenna array simulation libraries, changing the orientation of an antenna array (`PlanarArray` in this case), if supported, might involve methods or parameters that allow you to specify the azimuth and elevation angles, or perhaps a rotation matrix.\n\nSince your question is specifically about Sionna's `PlanarArray` and visualizing rotated positions, I recommend checking the documentation for `PlanarArray` or equivalent class within the Sionna package. Look for attributes or methods related to \"orientation\", \"rotation\", \"azimuth\", or \"elevation\". If such parameters exist, they should allow you to change the orientation by setting their values accordingly.\n\nTo visualize rotated positions, you would typically need to adjust the antenna orientation as described above and then use visualization tools provided by the library. Sionna provides functions like `render()`, `render_to_file()`, and `preview()` for scene visualization. You would use these methods to visualize the scene after applying the rotation to the `PlanarArray`.\n\nHere is a general outline of steps you might follow, assuming that methods exist for changing orientation (please check Sionna's actual documentation for the exact methods and their usage):\n\n1. Instantiate and set up your `PlanarArray` with the initial parameters.\n\n2. Use provided methods to change the orientation of the `PlanarArray`. It might look something like this (note that these are hypothetical since the exact methods are not provided in the context):\n   ```python\n   array = PlanarArray( ...initial parameters... )\n   array.set_orientation(azimuth=45, elevation=30)\n   ```\n\n3. Create a `Scene` that includes the `PlanarArray`.\n\n4. Preview or render the scene with the rotated `PlanarArray` using `preview()`, `render()`, or `render_to_file()` to visualize the antenna in its rotated position:\n   ```python\n   scene = Scene(...components including the rotated PlanarArray...)\n   scene.preview()  # For in-notebook visualization\n   scene.render_to_file(\"scene_with_rotated_array.png\")  # For file output\n   ```\n\nIf the exact methods for changing the orientation of a `PlanarArray` and visualizing it are not clear from the Sionna documentation or the provided context, I advise consulting the Sionna API reference or looking at example code that illustrates how antenna orientations are modified within the library.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points.

Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

Snell's law states:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( n_1 \\) is the refractive index of the medium from which the incident ray comes,\n- \\( \\theta_1 \\) is the angle of the incident ray measured from the normal to the interface between the two media,\n- \\( n_2 \\) is the refractive index of the medium into which the light is being refracted,\n- \\( \\theta_2 \\) is the angle of the refracted ray with respect to the normal.\n\nThis law implies that as light moves from a medium with a lower refractive index (higher speed of light) to a medium with a higher refractive index (lower speed), the refracted ray will bend towards the normal, or when light moves from a higher index of refraction to a lower one, the refracted ray will bend away from the normal.\n\nLet's denote the propagation vectors in the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves as \\( \\mathbf{k}_1, \\mathbf{k}_r, \\) and \\( \\mathbf{k}_t \\) respectively. The unit vector of the interface in the direction perpendicular to the interface is \\( \\mathbf{m} = (0, 0, 1)^\\text{T} \\).\n\nThe angles for the reflected wave and the transmitted wave can be derived using vector relationships. The formula for the angle of reflection is derived from the reflection and the incident wave vectors as:\n\n\\[ \\theta_r = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{-\\mathbf{k}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\| \\mathbf{k}_i \\| \\cdot \\| \\mathbf{v} \\|} \\right) = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{k^2 - (1 + (\\text{Re}[S_i]))}\\cdot (\\text{Re}[E_i] + \\text{Re}[E_r])}{2\\|E_i\\| \\cdot \\|E_r\\|} \\right) \\]\n\nThe expression for the angle of transmission is determined from the incident and transmitted wave vectors. Since the wave is split into a transmitted and a reflected component, transmission only occurs in an effective medium when \\(n_1 = n_2\\), resulting in Snell's law. But generally,\n\n\\[ \\theta_t = \\cos^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{k}_t \\cdot \\mathbf{m}}{\\| \\mathbf{k}_t \\| \\cdot \\| \\mathbf{m} \\|} \\right) \\]\n\nIn this model, the reflection coefficient (scalar, not vector), \\( R \\), which is given by \\(\\left|\\text{Re}[S_i] + 1 \\right|^2\\) or \\(\\left|\\text{Re}[S_i] + 1 \\right|^2\\), is used to determine how much of the electric field in the incident wave is reflected. The transmitted wave vector can then be computed as\n\n\\[ k^{\\prime} = \\frac{1}{n} k; \\hspace{1em} k^{\\prime} \\cdot k^{\\prime} = k \\cdot k \\]\n\nwhere the magnitude is conserved. Finally, the transmitted field is computed using the ratio of transmitted to incident field vectors\n\n\\[ E_t = \\frac{k^z}{k^{\\prime z}} E_i \\]\n\nRemember that in this environment, we have chosen to neglect absorption, scattering, and depolarization effects, and that some terms have been combined to simplify the formulas from the initial coverage you are referring to, which typically were in exponential form in terms of magnitude and phase.   \n\nWhen analyzing Snell's law in the material based on the critical angle, \\( \\theta_c = \\arcsin(1/n) \\), we would find that when the angle of incidence \\( \\theta_i > \\theta_c \\), then total internal reflection occurs \u2013 no transmitted wave will escape into the second medium. This has some practical implications in the field of optics and the design of waveguides, for example.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nSnell's Law, also known as the Law of Refraction, relates the angle of incidence to the angle of refraction when a wave passes from one medium to another with different refractive indices. The law is mathematically expressed as:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nHere, \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the refractive indices of the first and second media, respectively, while \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, relative to the normal of the interface.\n\nTo determine the angles for reflected and transmitted waves using vector relationships, you will need to consider both the magnitude and direction of the wave vectors. The vector form of Snell's Law can be expressed using the incident wave vector \\( \\mathbf{k}_i \\), the transmitted wave vector \\( \\mathbf{k}_t \\), and the normal to the surface \\( \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\).\n\nFor a plane interface, the angles of incidence \\( \\theta_1 \\) and reflection \\( \\theta_r \\) are equal due to the law of reflection, which states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence:\n\n\\[ \\theta_r = \\theta_1 \\]\n\nThe transmitted angle \\( \\theta_2 \\), however, follows Snell's Law and can be derived by decomposing the incident wave vector into components perpendicular and parallel to the interface:\n\nFirst, we can express the incident wave vector as a combination of transverse and normal components relative to the interface plane:\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{k}_i = \\mathbf{k}_{i,\\parallel} + \\mathbf{k}_{i,\\perp} \\]\n\nThe reflected wave vector \\( \\mathbf{k}_r \\) has the same parallel component to the interface as the incident wave:\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{k}_r = \\mathbf{k}_{r,\\parallel} - \\mathbf{k}_{r,\\perp} = \\mathbf{k}_{i,\\parallel} - \\mathbf{k}_{i,\\perp} \\]\n\nThe transmitted wave vector can be found using the scalar form of Snell\u2019s Law:\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{k}_{t,\\parallel} = \\mathbf{k}_{i,\\parallel} \\]\n\nAnd for the perpendicular component, we use:\n\n\\[ \\lVert \\mathbf{k}_{t,\\perp} \\rVert = k_t \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nWhere \\( k_t \\) is the magnitude of the transmitted wave vector, which relates to the refractive index of the second medium:\n\n\\[ k_t = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} k_i \\]\n\nHere, \\( k_i \\) is the magnitude of the incident wave vector. The above relationships imply that the parallel component remains unchanged, while the magnitude of the perpendicular component is scaled by the ratio of the refractive indices. With \\( \\mathbf{k}_{t,\\perp} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{k}_{t,\\parallel} \\) known, we can obtain the full transmitted wave vector \\( \\mathbf{k}_t \\).\n\nThe eventual formulas connecting the electric field vectors of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves (which are not explicitly detailed in the given context) involve the Fresnel equations, which provide the ratios of the electric field amplitudes. These equations characterize how the wave's electric field vectors are modified upon reflection or refraction.\n\nTo fully derive these angles and amplitudes from the provided vector relationship, a comprehensive understanding of vector mathematics and electromagnetic theory is necessary, as these derivations typically involve cross products, dot products, and the manipulation of sine and cosine functions in three dimensions, which is not directly provided in the context.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled.

The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

This function accepts the file path as input and will return the data in the form of a NumPy array which can then be used in your analysis.\n\n    - For example, to load a saved Frequency Covariance Matrix, you would have a line of code similar to the following:\n\n    ```python\n    freq_cov_mat = np.load('path_to_saved_frequency_cov.npy')\n    ```\n\n    - To load the saved Time Covariance Matrix, you would do the following:\n\n    ```python\n    time_cov_mat = np.load('path_to_saved_time_cov.npy')\n    ```\n\n    - To load the saved Space Covariance Matrix, you would use:\n\n    ```python\n    space_cov_mat = np.load('path_to_saved_space_cov.npy')\n    ```\n\n3. **Return the Covariance Matrices**: Using the above steps, you will be able to access and load the frequency, time, and space covariance matrices for your Sionna channel modeling needs. These matrices are key components in simulating and analyzing the channel characteristics of the signal transmission in a wireless communication system.\n\nRemember to replace `'path_to_saved_frequency_cov.npy'`, `'path_to_saved_time_cov.npy'`, and `'path_to_saved_space_cov.npy'` with the actual file paths of your saved covariance matrices, which should have been saved previously as `.npy` files using NumPy's `np.save` function.\n\nNote also that while loading covariance matrices, be sure to understand their use as these matrices can describe how power is distributed or correlated across different frequencies, times, or spatial dimensions in a communication channel, influencing the behavior of the transmitted signals.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo load the frequency, time, and space covariance matrices from saved `.npy` files using NumPy in the context of Sionna's channel modeling capabilities, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure you have NumPy imported in your Python environment. If you haven't imported NumPy already, you can do so using the `import numpy as np` statement.\n\n2. Use the `np.load` function to load each of the `.npy` files that contain the saved covariance matrices. You will need to provide the file name as a string to the `np.load` function. This function returns the matrix stored in the `.npy` file.\n   \n   - For the frequency covariance matrix, you would load it with the following line of code:\n     ```python\n     FREQ_COV_MAT = np.load('freq_cov_mat.npy')\n     ```\n     \n   - For the time covariance matrix, you would load it with:\n     ```python\n     TIME_COV_MAT = np.load('time_cov_mat.npy')\n     ```\n   \n   - And for the space covariance matrix, you would use:\n     ```python\n     SPACE_COV_MAT = np.load('space_cov_mat.npy')\n     ```\n\n3. After loading the matrices, you can manipulate or visualize them as needed. For instance, to visualize these matrices, you might use matplotlib to create plots.\n\nHere is a summary of the actual code you'll use to accomplish the tasks mentioned above:\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary library\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the covariance matrices from their respective .npy files\nFREQ_COV_MAT = np.load('freq_cov_mat.npy')\nTIME_COV_MAT = np.load('time_cov_mat.npy')\nSPACE_COV_MAT = np.load('space_cov_mat.npy')\n```\n\nWith these steps, the frequency, time, and space covariance matrices should now be loaded and ready for use in Sionna's channel modeling tasks.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nIllustrate how to configure the usage of a single GPU and adjust memory allocation for running Sionna simulations on TensorFlow.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nTo illustrate how to configure the usage of a single GPU and adjust memory allocation for running Sionna simulations on TensorFlow, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Select the GPU to use**: You can specify which GPU to use for training to avoid conflicts when multiple GPUs are available. Set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable whose value is the index of the GPU you want to use. For example, to use the first GPU (0-based index), set it like this before you import TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = \"0\"  # to use the first GPU\n```\n\n2. **Allow Memory Growth**: TensorFlow may allocate all GPU memory by default when it is first used. To avoid this, we set GPU memory growth. This will allow TensorFlow to allocate memory as needed and prevent it from preemptively reserving all available memory. Use the following code before TensorFlow is initialized:\n\n```python\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)  # assuming we're using the first GPU\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n3. **Limit GPU memory allocation**: Creating a TensorFlow configuration and a session can help in limiting the amount of GPU memory you want to allocate for your current process. \n\nHere is a snippet showing how you can accomplish this using `tf.ConfigProto` and `tf.Session` (note that this is not typical for TensorFlow 2.x, but it's still valid and can be important when compatibility with older versions is required):\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        # Set the fractions for GPU memory\n        fraction = 0.5  # use 50% of the memory\n        per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = True\n        if per_process_gpu_memory_fraction:\n            gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=fraction)\n        else:\n            gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(allow_growth=True)\n        config = tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=False, gpu_options=gpu_options)\n        session = tf.Session(config=config)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n4. **Use configuration when setting up TensorFlow**: In TensorFlow 2.x, you do not set up these aspects as explicitly. TensorFlow 2.x has an API that uses `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` along with contexts and functions to configure memory allocation. Refer to the most recent TensorFlow documentation for specific ways to configure memory use in TensorFlow 2.x.\n\nRemember to apply the settings before you start running your Sionna simulations as shown above. This setup allows you to control how much GPU memory TensorFlow consumes while ensuring that TensorFlow will use the designated GPU for your simulations, provided that the Sionna installation is configured to run on the GPU. Moreover, it helps to prevent TensorFlow from having issues like preemptively grabbing all of your GPU memory.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo run Sionna simulations using TensorFlow with a single GPU and adjusting memory allocation, you can set up your TensorFlow environment to control which GPU is visible and how much memory it is allowed to allocate. Below is an illustration of how you could configure TensorFlow for this purpose, assuming you are working with TensorFlow 2.x and Sionna, an end-to-end communication system simulator.\n\n1. **Select a Single GPU to Use**: Before TensorFlow starts its operations, specify which GPU to use. This will ensure that TensorFlow only sees one GPU and will not try to allocate memory on others. Here is how to set the device:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   gpu_num = 0  # Specify the GPU index you want to use, for example '0' for the first GPU.\n   os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = str(gpu_num)\n   ```\n\n   In the provided context, this is done by setting the `gpu_num` variable and updating the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable.\n\n2. **Adjust Memory Allocation**: TensorFlow by default tries to allocate as much GPU memory as possible which might not be optimal. To enable dynamic memory allocation so that TensorFlow only allocates the necessary memory and can grow as needed, you can use the `set_memory_growth` function:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n   if gpus:\n       try:\n           tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n       except RuntimeError as e:\n           # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized\n           print(e)\n   ```\n\n   This snippet lists the physical GPU devices and then sets memory growth on the first detected GPU. It's important to note that memory growth must be set before the GPUs are utilized by the TensorFlow graph.\n\n3. **(Optional) Limit GPU Memory Usage**: In some scenarios, you may also want to limit the total amount of memory that TensorFlow can use on a GPU. This is not directly illustrated in the provided context, but here's a code snippet that shows how to do it:\n\n   ```python\n   if gpus:\n       try:\n           memory_limit = 1024  # Set this to the amount of memory you want to allocate in MB\n           tf.config.experimental.set_virtual_device_configuration(\n               gpus[0],\n               [tf.config.experimental.VirtualDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=memory_limit)]\n           )\n       except RuntimeError as e:\n           print(e)\n   ```\n\n   This code sets a virtual device with a fixed memory limit, which can be helpful if you want to run other applications on the GPU that require memory or if you're running multiple TensorFlow processes simultaneously.\n\nIn the context provided, the code for setting the single GPU usage and dynamic memory allocation are already specified. You can follow the same principles outlined above to tweak the configuration to fit specific requirements.\n\nRemember to import TensorFlow before running these configurations and to place these instructions at the beginning of the script, before any TensorFlow operations are defined. This will prevent any issues with initializations that can occur if memory configurations are set after TensorFlow has already started allocating GPU memory.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

As this class is central to the functionality of the MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector, knowledge of low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded multiple-antenna transmissions, previous symbol mapping for constant-modulus of the input constellation, and the symbol-wise energy normalization mentioned in the context would be relevant.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates how the `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` in Sionna performs soft-to-hard symbol decisions for MIMO receivers:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.mimo.detector import MaximumLikelihoodDetector\n\n# Assuming you have already obtained soft symbol log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)\n# for a MIMO system and stored them in the `soft_llrs` variable, where\n# the shape of `soft_llrs` would be [batch, num_streams, num_symbols].\n\n# The MaximumLikelihoodDetector operates directly on log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\nhard_decisions, turbo_apriori = MaximumLikelihoodDetector(decision_metric=\"euclidean\").compute_hard_decisions(soft_states=soft_llrs)\n\n```\n\nIn the above code snippet:\n- We use the `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` with the `\"euclidean\"` decision metric, which is synonymous with L2 norm within the context of the class's documentation.\n- `soft_llrs` is a placeholder where the actual soft symbol LLRs would be the input to the system after receiving and demapping all possible constellation points for a given transmitted signal.\n\nThe `compute_hard_decisions` method of the `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` class is responsible for taking these LLRs and computing hard decisions on each given symbol. LLRs are numerical values related to the probability that a given symbol is the true transmitted symbol, given the received signal and the channel state information.\n\nThe `hard_decisions` array would typically comprise hard decisions on each possible transmitted symbol based on the LLRs. These hard decisions are often in the form of indexes within the constellation, in other words, they represent the closest constellation point for each transmitted symbol. The output varible `turbo_apriori` is used in the context of turbodecoding (LDPC decoding in a loop structure), but otherwise it can be ignored for standard symbol detection and error correction using LDPC codes.\n\nThe actual method used for computing the hard decisions would be based on specific constraint metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance), but the precise mathematical implementation is abstracted away from this code snippet. The actual calculations are performed by TensorFlow on a GPU (if available) to provide efficient processing capabilities.\n\nAs stated in the context, the output `hard_decisions` returned from the `compute_hard_decisions` method is of the shape `[..., self.num_streams]`, where the remaining dimensions are those with which the soft LLRs are indexed. This output is transformed into bit-wise indices for QAM constellations because the soft LLRs are used in previous symbol mapping process for computing bit-wise LLRs. These decisions are used to estimate the transmitted codewords for decoding.\n\nTo ensure that the method produces the necessary hard decisions for MIMO symbol detection, Sionna's `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` essentially operates by taking already computed symbol-wise log-likelihood ratios and transforming these to bit-wise indices through a further processing step which consolidates the expansion that was previously performed on the symbols during the symbol mapping process.\n\nThe choice of hard decisions over soft decisions about the transmitted symbols is desirable in practice due to the ease of feeding these bits into existing decoders that mostly work with bit representatives rather than symbol values.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` class within the Sionna MIMO ML detector computes hard decisions on symbols based on the method described for the computation of hard decisions when the `hard_out` parameter is set to `True`. \n\nThis is done by employing a maximum likelihood (ML) detection approach assuming a certain channel model, where `y` is the received signal vector, `H` is the known channel matrix, `x` is the vector of transmitted symbols uniformly and independently drawn from the constellation `C`, and `n` is a complex Gaussian noise vector.\n\nThe ML detection process involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Whitening the Received Signal:** The received signal `y` is first whitened using the noise covariance matrix `S`. The whitened received signal vector is given by `tilde{y} = S^(-1/2) * y`. This step results in a transformed channel matrix `tilde{H} = S^(-1/2) * H` and a whitened noise vector `tilde{n}`.\n\n2. **Computing Hard Decisions:** When hard decisions are requested (`hard_out=True`), hard-decided constellation symbol indices for each stream are computed by finding the constellation point `c` that maximizes the probability given the transformed received signal `tilde{y}`, the transformed channel matrix `tilde{H}`, and the possible transmitted symbols `x_k = c`. The hard decision for the k-th stream can be expressed mathematically as:\n   $$\n   \\hat{c}_k = \\underset{c \\in \\mathcal{C}}{\\text{argmax}} \\left( \\sum_{\\mathbf{x} : x_k = c} \\exp\\left(\n                -\\left\\lVert\\tilde{\\mathbf{y}}-\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}\\mathbf{x}\\right\\rVert^2\n                \\right)\\Pr\\left( \\mathbf{x} \\right) \\right)\n   $$\n   where `C` is the set of constellation points and `Pr(x)` is the prior probability distribution of the constellation points (used when `with_prior` flag is set).\n\nThe class supports both the use of prior information (`with_prior=True`) and operation without priors (`with_prior=False`). The prior information can be provided as Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) for bits or as logits for individual constellation points.\n\nNote that the exact implementation details, such as specific TensorFlow functions or classes used to perform matrix operations, the whitening process, the calculation of probabilities, or the loop over the constellation points, are not provided in the given context. Also, the provided context does not specify the coding or handling of the cases when the `with_prior` parameter affects the ML detection process.\n\nFor a detailed and specific implementation of the method, users are encouraged to refer to the actual source code of the `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` class which adheres to the mathematical principles outlined above.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled.

The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nExplain the importance of GPU configuration for running Sionna simulations and provide the Python code to configure GPU usage for Sionna.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\n## Explanation of GPU Configuration for Sionna Simulations\n\nThe choice of where to run deep-learning simulations, suchif as with a library like Sionna, is an important consideration for performance and resource management. While Sionna and many other machine learning libraries are capable of running on both CPUs and GPUs, using a GPU can significantly speed up the computations due to the highly-parallel architecture of GPUs. \n\nWhen running Sionna simulations, the configuration of GPU usage affects which parts of the code are executed on the GPU; it is thus critical to set up the GPU in your environment correctly. For applications like those discussed in Sionna tutorials, such as 5G link level simulations and RayTracer measurements, running on a GPU helps to optimize the training and inference time of machine learning models. In TensorFlow, which Sionna is built on, the `\"TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL\"` can be set to filter TensorFlow logging output, making it easier to manage the log verbosity in the simulation environment.\n\n## Python Code to Configure GPU Usage for Sionna\n\nIf you have a Sionna scenario, you can configure Sionna GPU usage as depicted in this Python snippet:\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.python.client import device_lib\n\n# Check if Tensorflow can see our GPU(s)\ngpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n\n# If there is (are) a GPU(s), then only allocate as much GPU memory as needed\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        for gpu in gpus:\n            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n    # If setting memory growth isn't available, then just skip it\n        print(e)\n        \n# (Optional) Set an environment variable to optimize memory management and filter verbosity\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nIn this Python code snippet:\n\n- We first import TensorFlow and check for any physical GPUs available. If there are GPUs, we apply memory growth. This is an important step to prevent TensorFlow from allocating all the video memory at once, which can make memory management more efficient and allow the Keras to begin running computations while TensorFlow is still allocating GPU memory.\n  \n- The `_set_memory_growth` function is used to set memory growth configurability on a specified physical GPU. Setting memory growth to `True` allows TensorFlow to allocate GPU memory only as much as needed, preventing pre-allocation of the full GPU memory, which can be detrimental when you have more users and processes sharing a GPU.\n\n- Finally, we set up an environment variable to manage TensorFlow's logging level. Setting the `_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` variable to 3 configures TensorFlow to only display `<ERROR>` messages, so the logs are not flooded with debug and info logs, which can be irrelevant and overwhelming. \n\nThe snippets in the context related to `MNIST` and ADMM are not directly related to configuring GPU usage in Sionna, thus not included for GPU configuration purpose. They depict sample code which might be used for training a classifier on the MNIST dataset and demonstrate the performance improvements achievable using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for the training process.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nIn simulations of wireless communications systems, like the MIMO OFDM system demonstrated with Sionna, the computational complexity can be high. This often stems from the need to process large amounts of data to simulate the transmission, channel effects, equalization, and decoding accurately. Computational aspects like matrix multiplications, convolutions, and iterative decoding algorithms used in Sionna simulations are inherently parallelizable tasks, which makes them well-suited for execution on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).\n\nA GPU consists of hundreds of cores capable of handling thousands of threads simultaneously. This gives it the ability to perform large scale matrix operations and data processing much faster than a CPU, especially for simulations where the same operations are repeated many times for different sets of data (such as Monte Carlo simulations).\n\nConfiguring GPU usage for Sionna allows simulations to run significantly faster, enabling more extensive parameter sweeps and larger scales of simulations to be run within a practical timeframe. This is vital for research and development where time-to-results can be critical.\n\nHere's an excerpt of the Python code provided in the context, which can be used to configure a single GPU and set memory growth to prevent TensorFlow from allocating all the memory on the GPU in advance:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Set the GPU number to use. Change the gpu_num variable to select a different GPU.\ngpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n\n# Set TensorFlow log level to only display errors\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n\n# Configure TensorFlow to use only a single GPU and allocate only as much memory as needed\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        # Only allocate as much GPU memory as needed for the runtime allocations\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[gpu_num], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        # Print the exception if it occurred\n        print(e)\n\n# Set the logger level to ERROR to reduce log clutter\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nIt is important to note the following from the provided code:\n\n- The variable `gpu_num` is used to specify which GPU to use. If the system has multiple GPUs, they are typically indexed starting at 0. If you wish to use CPU instead, you would set `gpu_num` to an empty string `\"\"`.\n- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is an environment variable that controls which GPUs are visible to CUDA applications like TensorFlow.\n- The command `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` allows the GPU to allocate only as much memory as needed at a given time, rather than allocating all available GPU memory upfront. This can help to avoid memory allocation issues when running multiple GPU applications simultaneously.\n- `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` is set to `'3'` to reduce TensorFlow logging output, which can be verbose.\n\nBefore deploying this code, ensure that TensorFlow and appropriate NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit are installed, as these are prerequisites for enabling GPU acceleration in TensorFlow-based applications such as Sionna.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled.

The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process.

Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

This method will be wrapper to the\n# 'lmmse_mse_estimator' which is an instance of 'LMMSEMSEEstimator' from Sionna.\n```\n\nWith these settings in place, you can calculate the equalized symbol vectors and effective noise variances as follows:\n\n- **Calculating the mean squared error (MSE) estimation**:\n  - This is done using a pre-defined method, `mse_estimator()`. The result, `MSE`, will be required later in the equalization process.\n\n```python\nh_est = your_channel_estimator(y, your_channel_model)  # Channel estimation\nmse_estimator = lmmse_mse_estimator(\u03a6, no, pilot_pattern)  # Initialize MSE estimator\nMSE = mse_estimator(h_est)  # Calculate the MSE\n```\n\n- **Perform LMMSE channel estimation and equalization**:\n  - This step includes calculating the channel estimates and applying them to the received signal 'y' to get the equalized symbol vectors 'x_hat' and effective noise variances 'no_eff'.\n\n```python\nlmmse_equalizer = LMMSEEqualizer(pilot_matrix, mse_estimator, pilot_pattern)  # Initialize the LMMSE equalizer\nH_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(h_est)  # Perform LMMSE channel estimation\nx_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, no)  # Apply the LMMSE equalizer to the received signal\n```\n\nIn this example, `H_hat` represents the estimated channel responses, `no_eff` is the effective noise variance, `x_hat` represents the equalized symbol vectors, and `MSE` represents the Mean Squared Error.\n\nPlease note that 'y' is the noise-corrupted observation across the OFDM resource grid, which you should obtain according to your simulation or practical setup. 'h_est' is your estimate of the channel 'h', and 'no' is the variance of the additive noise.\n\nEnsure that `your_channel_estimator` is replaced with a custom function that implements your chosen method for channel estimation, and `your_channel_model` represents the model of your communication channel, such as a Rayleigh fading channel model. The function `lmmse_mse_estimator` is used to calculate the MSE for LMMSE equalization based on pilot signals, and the effective noise variable `no_eff` will be obtained after running lmmse equalization.\n\nThe output, after running the LMMSE equalization, includes equalized symbol vectors `x_hat` and the effective noise variance estimates `no_eff`, which are the results of the equalization process.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo calculate equalized symbol vectors and effective noise variance estimates using the `lmmse_equalizer` in Sionna, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the dimensions of your channel. In a MIMO system, `M` represents the number of receive antennas, and `K` represents the number of transmit antennas.\n\n2. Assemble the received signal vector `y` which should be a tensor of complex numbers with a shape corresponding to [..., M], where \"...\" represents zero or more batch dimensions.\n\n3. Construct the known channel matrix `h` which is a tensor of complex numbers with a shape [..., M, K].\n\n4. Formulate the noise covariance matrix `s` representing the expected noise on the received signal. This matrix should be a tensor of complex numbers with a shape [..., M, M].\n\n5. Decide whether to whiten the interference before equalization. This can be controlled by the `whiten_interference` parameter, which is `True` by default.\n\n6. Call `lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s, whiten_interference=True)` to perform the LMMSE equalization. This function will return two tensors: `x_hat`, which contains the estimated symbol vectors and `no_eff`, which contains the effective noise variance estimates per symbol.\n\nHere is an example code snippet to illustrate the use of `lmmse_equalizer` based on the provided context:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport sionna\n\n# Assuming you have already defined or obtained the following tensors:\n# y: the received signal vector with shape [..., M]\n# h: the known channel matrix with shape [..., M, K]\n# s: the noise covariance matrix with shape [..., M, M]\n\n# Perform LMMSE equalization\nx_hat, no_eff = sionna.mimo.lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s, whiten_interference=True)\n\n# x_hat now contains the equalized symbol vectors\n# no_eff contains the estimates of the effective noise variances\n```\n\nIn this example, `x_hat` will be a tensor of shape [..., K] containing the equalized symbol vectors, and `no_eff` will be a tensor of the same shape containing the effective noise variance estimates. The exact shapes of `x_hat` and `no_eff` will depend on the batch dimensions included in the input tensors `y`, `h`, and `s`.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

To illustrate its usage, we must understand its intended application in 5G New Radio physical layer simulations.\n\nIn the context of OFDM-based uplink system simulations, such as those typically found in 5G communication specifications, channel estimation and data detection are critical functions. The KBestDetector is designed to take a set of OFDM received symbol vectors (after convolutional coding and modulation) and apply LS (Least Squares) uplink channel estimation. This can be carried out jointly (as defined by the aforementioned algorithm in [FT2015]), across different transmit antennas and layers (where MIMO processing is employed). The KBestDetector handles QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), mapping of coded bits to symbols, and channel interpolation using a specific comb-type interpolation based on subcarrier indices.\n\nIn order to use the KBestDetector in practice, one must initialize the detector object and then apply it to the received OFDM signal, along with knowledge of the resource grid, channel, and noise covariance matrices. The actual usage of the KBestDetector requires the instantiation of the detector and the provision of channel state information (CSI). This can be done in the following steps *after* defining the necessary components for the simulation as per the detailed context unrelated to this specific class:\n\n```python\n# After defining the necessary components for the simulation:\nk_best_detector = KBestDetector(num_detected_streams_per_user_per_sector,\n                                num_detected_users_per_sector,\n                                num_detected_streams_per_user_per_sector,\n                                per_sector_user_base,\n                                interpolation_subtype=interpolation_type)\n\n# Estimate channel that is ideally LS-based (knowledge of the channel noise not assumed)\nh_ls, h_norm_ls, w_pilot_is = gen_prime_mrt_weights_perfect_csi_ls(num_rx, \n                                                                   num_rx_ant, \n                                                                   get_ofdm_cb_size(fft_size), \n                                                                   config.channel_model)\nh = uplink_rmu_co_stream_channel(sample_ofdm_noisy_cb(),\n                                 randint(num_rbu, num_transmitters * config.mrt),\n                                 h_ls, # Channel test with MRT weights\n                                 n0) # Noise variance\n# Apply the detector to the received signal, using known noise variance and the least squares channel estimation\nl_bcd_jdet = k_best_detector(ys,  # Received signal\n                             h,   # Least squares channel estimation\n                             n_ov,  # Noise covariance matrix\n                             h,  # Current channel estimate\n                             per_rx_sector,  # The hypersector per receiver \n                             per_rx_apped_scenario # Which scenario is used\n                             )\n```\n\nThis implementation illustrates the basic usage of the KBestDetector. The initialized KBestDetector object is applied to the received OFDM signal `y_s` using least squares channel estimation, requiring the noise covariance matrix `n_ov`. The function also takes the current channel estimation `\u0125`, the description of the spatial components, and the apped pattern for a resource block.\n\nThe function in the provided context is compatible with the functionality of Sionna (atmosphere), a software package that eases the path from theory to simulation, aiming to make large system performance evaluation (LSPE) an efficient process. The provided snippet shows how to leverage certain classes and functions from Sionna to simulate an uplink transmission in a 5G NR environment.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo illustrate the usage of the `KBestDetector` as described in [FT2015], you would typically follow these steps within a compatible software environment:\n\n1. **Instantiate the KBestDetector:**\n   Create a `KBestDetector` object with the required parameters like `output`, `num_streams`, `k`, etc. If you are working on a specific MIMO problem with predefined parameters, use those. Otherwise, choose these parameters according to the needs of the simulation or the problem you are solving.\n\n2. **Prepare Input Data:**\n   You should have the received signal vector `y`, the channel matrix `h`, and the noise covariance matrix `s`.\n\n3. **Invoke the Detector:**\n   Use the `KBestDetector` instance to process the input data and obtain the desired output, which can be either bit-level or symbol-level information, depending on the `output` parameter provided during instantiation.\n\nBelow is an abstracted code example of how the `KBestDetector` might be used. Remember that since we don't have access to the complete documentation, variables like `num_bits_per_symbol` have to be appropriately set according to specific MIMO system properties.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.mimo import KBestDetector\n\n# Step 1: Instantiate the KBestDetector\n# Replace the placeholder values with actual parameters\nkbest_detector = KBestDetector(\n    output='bit',             # Output type; \"bit\" for bit-level, \"symbol\" for symbol-level\n    num_streams=2,            # Number of transmitted streams\n    k=10,                     # Number of paths to keep in the K-Best algorithm\n    constellation_type='qam', # Type of constellation used (e.g., 'qam', 'pam', or 'custom')\n    num_bits_per_symbol=4,    # Number of bits per constellation symbol (e.g., 4 for QAM16)\n    hard_out=False,           # Whether hard decisions should be returned\n    dtype=tf.complex64        # Precision used for internal computations\n)\n# Note: Depending on whether `use_real_rep` and `constellation` are needed,\n# additional parameters need to be set here.\n\n# Step 2: Prepare input data\n# Placeholder tensors, replace with actual input data\ny = tf.placeholder(tf.complex64, shape=[None, M]) # Received signals\nh = tf.placeholder(tf.complex64, shape=[None, M, num_streams]) # Channel matrices\ns = tf.placeholder(tf.complex64, shape=[None, M, M]) # Noise covariance matrices\n\n# Step 3: Invoke the Detector\n# Process the input data and obtain bit-level output\nbit_output = kbest_detector((y, h, s))\n\n# Continue with the rest of the simulation or processing\n```\n\nPlease ensure that the placeholder values are replaced with actual data from your MIMO system. The `KBestDetector` will provide an approximate solution to the MIMO detection problem by considering the best `k` number of candidates for the transmitted symbol vector.\n\nIn real applications, further accompanying data preparation and post-processing steps would be necessary, but these fall outside the scope of the instructions provided.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled.

The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12.

The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nExplain how to use the \"Sionna\" package to implement a neural receiver for OFDM SIMO systems.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nTo implement a neural receiver for OFDM-SIMO systems using the Sionna package, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Dataset**:\n   To implement a neural receiver, you first need to create or obtain a dataset that represents your communication system in a form that can be fed into a neural network. This dataset should include the transmitted QAM symbols, the channel model, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation grid, and noise variance if you are training the network or for testing and evaluation purposes.\n\n2. **Select the Learning Rate Schedule and Training Time**:\n   For the neural receiver to be effectively trained, you need to determine the learning rate and also the schedule at which it updates for the training process. A commonly used approach would be to start training at a full learning rate and then applying some form of learning rate schedule, such as opt.lr.exponential for example. The number of epochs (training iterations) to perform could also be chosen, typically thousands or millions of training steps to reach convergence.\n\n3. **Define the Neural Network Architecture**:\n   You must define the architecture of your neural receiver. The Sionna package may provide pre-built network components such as ML(Split)-MIMO Precoders; VLC BP Decoder; and KEP Predictor, Forward krb, and apps for differentiable pre-rxb alternatives. The neural receiver could include components like the channel models, inversion and estimation functionalities, etc. You might then compile and internally rank the architecture with an optimization tool such as `GPflowOptktOptimizer`, selecting the best architecture according to the Internal_Metric and External_Metric.\n\n4. **Create the Neural Receiver**:\n   Within the Sionna framework, you instantiate a new neural receiver by configuring and compiling the neural network architecture. The parameters of this model, such as the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, dropout rates, etc. are often crucial to determine the model's performance.\n\n5. **Train the Neural Receiver**:\n   With the prepared dataset, start training the newly created neural receiver using the defined learning rate schedule and number of epochs. At each step, back-propagation will update the internal weights and architecture of the network to minimize the loss function, which reflects the performance of your neural receiver against the training set.\n\n6. **Run the Evaluation**:\n   After training, you can assess the effectiveness of the neural receiver. Typically, the neural receiver is evaluated over different Eb/N0 values to generate receiver performance curves and compared with traditional receivers to demonstrate gains in performance.\n\n7. **Save and Restore Parameters**:\n   Sionna, like other deep learning frameworks, allows you to save and restore the parameters of the model for inference or further optimization. Serialization and deserialization methods allow for seamless management of the trained models.\n\nThis process may leverage GPU acceleration and could greatly benefit from appropriate data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to aid in the training and evaluation tasks. Additionally, accurately simulating the physical transmission layer using tools like the Sionna library is crucial for designing and validating the neural receiver's performance.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe \"Sionna\" package provides the tools to simulate and implement communication systems within a TensorFlow framework, which is particularly useful for applying deep learning techniques to communication system components such as receivers. In the context provided, the package is used to implement a neural receiver for OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) SIMO (Single Input Multiple Output) systems. Here\u2019s a general step-by-step guide on how you would use Sionna to implement a neural receiver for OFDM SIMO systems:\n\n1. **Environment Setup**:\n   - Ensure the necessary GPU configuration and dependencies are set up by specifying the appropriate GPU (if available) and installing the Sionna package as shown in the provided Python code snippet.\n\n2. **Import Packages**:\n   - Import necessary modules and components from TensorFlow and Sionna, such as the `ResourceGrid`, `StreamManagement`, `Antenna`, `AntennaArray`, `LDPC5GEncoder`, and `LDPC5GDecoder`, following the context instructions. This includes functions and classes for simulating channels, managing streams, OFDM processing, and FEC (Forward Error Correction) coding and decoding.\n\n3. **Define Simulation Parameters**:\n   - Define the simulation parameters for the channel configuration, OFDM waveform, modulation and coding configuration, and neural receiver configuration. For example, you would specify the carrier frequency, delay spread, CDL model, and modulation type, among other settings, as shown in the context.\n\n4. **Configure the System**:\n   - Configure the system components, such as the `StreamManagement` class to set the receiver-transmitter association, and initialize the `ResourceGrid` with the parameters defined earlier. Then, compute the codeword lengths for the LDPC code based on the configuration.\n\n5. **Design the Neural Receiver**:\n   - Design the Keras layers that implement the neural receiver. A typical neural receiver might have multiple residual blocks each containing convolutional layers that operate on the post-DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) received samples which form the resource grid. Implement the `ResidualBlock` class and the `NeuralReceiver` class as shown in the provided code snippet.\n\n6. **Training the Neural Receiver**:\n   - Train the neural receiver using post-DFT received samples. During training, the neural receiver substitutes traditional channel estimation, equalization, and demapping steps with the learned representation from the training data. You'll provide the resource grid and noise variance as inputs to the neural receiver and optimize it based on the target performance metrics, such as BER (Bit Error Rate).\n\n7. **Evaluate the Neural Receiver**:\n   - After training is complete, evaluate the performance of the neural receiver by comparing the predicted outputs against the known transmitted symbols. You may also compare the neural receiver's performance with traditional baseline receivers, such as those using LMMSE (Linear Minimum Mean Square Error) equalization with perfect CSI (Channel State Information) or LS (Least Squares) estimation.\n\nThis process involves leveraging deep learning to process the signal directly and learn an internal representation that can provide demodulated outputs or LLRs (Log-Likelihood Ratios) for the transmitted coded bits. The neural receiver architecture, as described, is capable of processing entire resource grids, which may include guard bands and pilot signals. Once the resource grid is processed through the neural network, irrelevant LLRs (such as those corresponding to pilots or guard bands) must be discarded to obtain the final data-carrying LLRs.\n\nPlease note that due to the highly specialized nature of the implementation and the required specialized knowledge in both communications theory and deep learning techniques, the steps provided here are conceptual and correct implementation will need deeper exploration of the particularities of the OFDM SIMO system model and the capabilities of the Sionna package.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

Additionally, ensure you have the Sionna library imported with the `sionna` alias.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import sionna as sn\n   ```\n\n2. **Prepare Simulation Results:**\n   Collect BLER results from your uplink grant simulation. You might have an array that contains BLERs for different setup configurations or payload capacities based on the code provided.\n\n   ```python\n   # Code to calculate simulation results and populate array 'bler'\n   # (As seen from the context: no explicit method to get the array is provided, place-holder 'bler' is used.)\n   # e.g., bler = [result1, result2, ...]\n   ```\n\n3. **Plot the Results:**\n   Plot the BLER results. As mentioned in the context, you could have utilized the following function or a similar function to help plot your results:\n\n   ```python\n   plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))\n   plt.plot('k', 'bler', label=\"simulation\", linestyle='-')\n   plt.yscale(\"log\")\n   plt.grid(which=\"both\")\n   plt.title(\"BLER of PUSCH with 5G LDPC Code\", fontsize=16)\n   plt.xlabel(\"Number of Information Bits (k)\", fontsize=14)\n   plt.ylabel(\"BLER\", fontsize=14)\n   plt.legend(fontsize=12)\n   plt.tick_params(direction=\"in\")\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n   This code snippet does the following:\n\n   - Configures the size of the figure window for a clear view.\n   - Plots the BLER (y-axis) against the number of information bits 'k' (x-axis).\n   - Uses a logarithmic scale on the y-axis to better visualize small BLER values.\n   - Shows gridlines to help interpret the data more accurately.\n   - Sets appropriate title, axis labels, and a legend for clarity.\n\n4. **Arrange the Plot for Presentation:**\n   To properly arrange the plot for a clear presentation:\n   \n   - Ensure that the plot is appropriately sized so that it is not too small to view details and not too large to waste space.\n   - Adjust the y-scale to logarithmic to visualize the BLER over a wide range of values.\n   - Define a title that clearly indicates what the plot represents (in this context, the BLER of PUSCH). The title should include the term \"Block Error Rate\" to be more specific.\n   - Both axis labels and legend font sizes should be readable, typically 12pt or above for presentation.\n   - Turn on gridlines to guide the viewer's eye across the plot. \n\n5. **Showcase the Plot:**\n   Display the plot, making sure it is uncluttered and easily readable. Avoiding overlapping lines on the plot and choosing a distinguishable pattern can help communicate the trends more effectively.\n\n   For efficient visualization, use different linestyles or colors if you are plotting multiple data points to help differentiate them.\n\n6. **Analysis and Interpretation:**\n   After visualizing the plot, always include an analysis or interpretation. Point out any trends you observe \u2014 for example, at what point adding more information bits significantly affects the BLER. Also, make sure to mention the impact on system performance since improving BLER indicates better reception for the data.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a clear and well-presented plot of BLER results from PUSCH simulations using `matplotlib` in Sionna for better interpretation and analysis.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo visualize Block Error Rate (BLER) results from Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) simulations using matplotlib, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up your environment:**\n   Ensure you have matplotlib and numpy libraries installed and imported in your Python environment. You will also need the output results from your PUSCH simulations, which should include SNR levels and corresponding BLER values.\n\n2. **Prepare the data:**\n   Arrange your simulation results into a structured format, like a dictionary or separate lists. You should have one list for your SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values (`ebno_db` in the given context) and another list for BLER results (`bler` in the given context).\n\n3. **Plot configuration:**\n   Before plotting, configure your figure to ensure clear presentation:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   \n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Set figure size for better visibility\n   plt.title(\"PUSCH BLER vs SNR\")  # Set title of the graph\n   plt.xlabel(\"SNR (dB)\")  # Label for the x-axis\n   plt.ylabel(\"BLER\")  # Label for the y-axis\n   plt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linestyle='--')  # Enable grid for easier reading\n   plt.yscale('log')  # Use logarithmic scale for BLER to view a wide range of values clearly\n   plt.xlim([min(SNR_list), max(SNR_list)])  # X-axis limits based on SNR values\n   plt.ylim([1e-5, 1])  # Y-axis limits for BLER range\n   ```\n\n4. **Plot the data:**\n   Use matplotlib's functions to plot BLER against SNR values. If there are multiple lines to plot (e.g., for different scenarios or methods), iterate over your data to create each line:\n\n   ```python\n   for i, scenario in enumerate(scenarios):\n       plt.semilogy(SNR_list, BLER_list[i], label=scenario)  # Logarithmic plot for BLER\n   ```\n\n   Include markers or line styles if you have multiple series to distinguish between them. In the context provided, you might want to differentiate between perfect and imperfect CSI, or different detector types.\n\n5. **Legends and Annotations:**\n   Adding a legend is critical when there are multiple lines or datasets in the same plot. You can also include annotations if needed to highlight specific points or observations.\n\n   ```python\n   plt.legend()  # Display legend to identify each line\n   ```\n\n6. **Show or Save the plot:**\n   Finally, display the plot on the screen or save it to a file for later use.\n\n   ```python\n   plt.show()  # Display the plot\n   \n   # Uncomment below line to save the figure instead\n   # plt.savefig(\"PUSCH_BLER_vs_SNR.png\", bbox_inches='tight')\n   ```\n   \nIn the context given, if the `SNR_list` and `BLER_list` are included in the dictionary `PUSCH_SIMS` under keys `\"ebno_db\"` and `\"bler\"` respectively, you can extract them like:\n\n```python\nSNR_list = PUSCH_SIMS[\"ebno_db\"]\nBLER_list = PUSCH_SIMS[\"bler\"]\n```\n\nAnd then use the provided method to visualize the results. Remember to match the variable names to the actual names used in your code for data extraction and plotting.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

The documentation provides a clear example of how this is done.\n\n```python\nimport sionna\n\n# Create a random tensor for demonstration purposes\nx = tf.random.uniform(shape=(2, 3, 5), minval=-1., maxval=1)\n\n# Append three dimensions of size 1 at axis 1\ny = sionna.utils.insert_dims(x, 1, 3)\n\n# Print the result to see the new shape\nprint(y.shape)  # this should print (2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5)\n\n# To ensure your subsequent operation can handle this correctly, \n# you may want to remove these trivial new dimensions with squeeze\nz = tf.squeeze(y, axis=2)  # this would give a new shape (2, 1, 1, 3, 5)\n\n# However, if you want to add multiple dimensions which are not length 1, you should resize (also remove 1-length dimensions if squeeze is necessary)\n# Insert two dimensions of size 2 after the batch dimension\n# and then remove new dimensions from the state\nu = sionna.utils.insert_dims(x, 0, 2)\nu = sionna.utils.resize(y, [2, 2, 1, 1], filter_size=1, causal=True, remove_trivial once=True)\nu = tf.squeeze(u, [0,4]) # Remove the newly added trivial dimension by squeezing the tensor from two different sides\n\n# Print the result to check the shape\nprint(u.shape)  # this should print (2, 2, 10, 3, 5)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `x` is a rank-three tensor with dimensions `(2, 3, 5)`.\n- We use `sionna.utils.insert_dims` to add three dimensions of size 1 at axis 1 to `x`, resulting in a new tensor `y` with shape `(2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5)`.\n- We remove the trivial dimensions we inserted using `tf.squeeze` to obtain a tensor `z` with shape `(2, 1, 1, 3, 5)`.\n- Then, `x` can also be resized to a tensor `u` with added dimensions of size 2 at the axis 0 with shape `(2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5)`.\n- Finally, `u` is pruned to a tensor `v` with shape `(2, 2, 10, 3, 5)` by removing the trivial dimensions using `tf.squeeze(u, [0, 4])`.\n  \nIn all cases, this is done efficiently without any data copy operations, which is important to avoid unnecessary overhead.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nBased on the context provided, there's no explicit reference to a function named \"insert_dims\" within the Sionna library documentation excerpts you've presented. It seems like you might be referring to a utility function for manipulating the dimensions of a tensor, similar to `np.expand_dims` in NumPy or `tf.expand_dims` in TensorFlow.\n\nHowever, given that \"insert_dims\" is not part of the provided context and does not appear to be a documented function in the Sionna library, I can't provide accurate instructions on how to use a function with this specific name in Sionna.\n\nIn TensorFlow, which Sionna is built upon, you could use `tf.expand_dims` to add length-one dimensions to a tensor, and you can specify the axis where you want the new dimensions to be added. Here's how you would typically use `tf.expand_dims` in regular TensorFlow code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Let's assume we have the following 2D tensor\ntensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\n# To append a single length-one dimension to this tensor at axis 0, you would do:\nexpanded_tensor = tf.expand_dims(tensor_2d, axis=0)\n\n# Now expanded_tensor has shape (1, 2, 2)\n\n# To add multiple length-one dimensions to specific axes, you could call tf.expand_dims multiple times:\nexpanded_tensor = tf.expand_dims(tensor_2d, axis=0) # Shape becomes (1, 2, 2)\nexpanded_tensor = tf.expand_dims(expanded_tensor, axis=-1) # Shape becomes (1, 2, 2, 1)\n\n# Note that you can specify negative indices for the axis parameter,\n# which counts from the last dimension backwards (where -1 refers to the last dimension).\n```\n\nIf there were a function `insert_dims` in Sionna, it would presumably allow you to specify multiple axes at once for inserting length-one dimensions. However, without specific documentation or context, I cannot demonstrate its usage.\n\nFor Sionna-related manipulation of tensor dimensions, it is best to refer to the official Sionna documentation or the TensorFlow API since Sionna is an extension of TensorFlow. If `insert_dims` exists in some version or extension of Sionna, it would be documented there, and that would be the reference for accurate instructions on its usage.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

To create a Hamming window, you would call `HammingWindow()` with parameters such as the window length and the oversample factor (`os`) for shaping the window passband-to-stopband transition. For a Blackman window, you would call `BlackmanWindow()` with similar parameters in addition to the \u03b2 parameter, which influences the sidelobe level.\n\n2. **Application:**\n   These windows can be applied to the time-domain OFDM signal within the simulation. However, their implementation details differ. The Hamming window can be directly applied by setting an `extra` parameter to specify its application mode, which would typically cover a range of samples across which the window operates, and the effective window length to define the windowed portion, taking into account the oversample factor. Instead, the Blackman window can be applied by defining the time-domain window samples directly in a Tensor and then multiplying it pointwise with a time-domain time-OFDM signal.\n\n## Specifics regarding Creation\n\n### HammingWindow\n- You can specify the `os` (oversampling factor) during creation to adjust the window for the given transition width. \n- An `extra` or `os` parameter can be set, which will determine the size and location of the non-zero part of the window.\n- The `return_time_windows` parameter will return both the time-domain window samples and its FFT, or else it will return a precomputed window sequence.\n- The `normalize` parameter will apply a normalization factor to the window to ensure a constant energy.\n\n### BlackmanWindow\n- For the Blackman window, alongside the `os`, you set a `length` to define the window length, much like the Hamming window.\n- You can specify the sidelobe level by choosing a `beta` value.\n- The window can be generated without any normalization constants and using a manually adjusted factor, if desired.\n\n1. **Similarities:**\n   - Both windows require the length of the window to be specified.\n   - Both windows are callable (functions).\n   - Both windows can be created with an explicit data type via the `dtype` argument.\n\n2. **Differences:**\n   - The Blackman window offers a better trade-off in the frequency domain, with lower sidelobes and better attenuation.\n   - The behavior of the Hamming window is specified by the `dtype` argument, whereas the Blackman window doesn't accept additional arguments aside from `length` and `dtype`.\n\n\n## Application\n\nWhen applied in the OFDM context, Hamming workings would replace nulls to mitigate the effects of the time and frequency domain nulls at the ends of the time window, as described by the corresponding tutorials. Specifically, the tutorial CommonPAPRTutorial demonstrates how the Hamming window can be transformed such that its pass-band nulls of the FFT transform suppress the onset of intersymbol interference (ISI).\n\nOn the other hand, BlackmanWindow can be applied to the entire signal without the need for timing adjustment (assuming that the filter comprises the entire signal duration) due to having a constant time property. Despite its constant time property, it doesn't enforce constraints on the passband, which may potentially lead to ISI.\n\nIn both cases, choosing the window and its parameters is governed by the specific needs and properties of the transmitted signal. A Hamming window may be better for ISI mitigation but at the expense of a greater decrease in bandwidth efficiency than a Blackman window might require.\n\nIn conclusion, **HammingWindow** and **BlackmanWindow** share the similarity of being pre-defined window functions that can be used in signal processing, and in Sionna, both are used for OFDM signal processing. Their primary difference lies in their peak-to-peak amplitude and, consequently, their side lobe properties, as well as the specific methods for applying them. These aspects are adjusted based on the desired windowing effect, such as the transition band properties or the need to adjust for time-domain effect on the signal.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe context provided does not include explicit details about the creation and application of HammingWindow and BlackmanWindow functions, as it primarily focuses on the overall signal processing module which includes windowing as a part of its functionality. The mentioned text primarily discusses the RootRaisedCosineFilter with a Hann window, various signal processing utilities, and operations like windowing, filtering, upsampling, downsampling, and computing the power spectral density (PSD) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of a signal.\n\nHowever, having a general understanding of window functions, we can discuss the Hamming and Blackman windows based on typical digital signal processing principles:\n\n**Hamming Window**: \nThe Hamming Window is a taper formed by using a weighted cosine function. It is defined as \n\\( w(n) = 0.54 - 0.46 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N-1}\\right) \\), \nwhere \\( N \\) is the window length, and \\( n \\) ranges from 0 to \\( N-1 \\). It is used to mitigate the side lobes of the Fourier transform of the signal, thereby reducing the spectral leakage. However, spectral leakage cannot be completely eliminated with the Hamming window; its purpose is to control it.\n\n**Blackman Window**: \nThe Blackman window is another type of taper which provides stronger side lobe attenuation compared to the Hamming window. It is defined as \n\\( w(n) = 0.42 - 0.5 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{N-1}\\right) + 0.08 \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi n}{N-1}\\right) \\), \nwhere the terms and symbols hold the same meaning as for the Hamming Window.\n\n**Similarities**:\n- Both are window functions, meaning they are applied to a signal to reduce the effects of spectral leakage during the Fourier Transform process.\n- Both weight samples near the center of the window more heavily than those near the edges, effectively tapering the signal to zero toward the boundaries.\n- They are both symmetric and used to minimize the discontinuities at the boundaries of a segmented signal in time-domain analysis.\n- Each window function multiplies the signal samples pointwise in order to apply the windowing effect.\n\n**Differences**:\n- The exact shape of the windows is different; the Blackman window has a more complex formulation with an extra cosine term.\n- The side lobe attenuation of the Blackman window is greater than the Hamming window. This means that Blackman provides better frequency resolution and is more effective in reducing spectral leakage at the cost of a wider main lobe, which can affect the ability to resolve closely spaced frequency components.\n- The Blackman window generally has a higher dynamic range (the ratio of the main lobe peak to the highest side lobe peak) compared to the Hamming window.\n\nIn the context of the provided text from the signal processing module, it's demonstrated how to apply a window function while filtering QAM baseband symbols with a root-raised-cosine filter. Specifically, a Hann window is used in the provided example, which shares some characteristics with the Hamming window but is different in its formulation.\n\nTo provide accurate information on creating and applying HammingWindow and BlackmanWindow using the Sionna module, one would need to refer to the source code or documentation for that specific module, neither of which is included in the context provided.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled.

The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification.

The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nAsk the model to explain the purpose of the PUSCHConfig, PUSCHTransmitter, and PUSCHReceiver classes in Sionna's 5G NR module.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nThe PUSCHConfig, PUSCHTransmitter, and PUSCHReceiver classes in Sionna\u2019s 5G NR module offer a comprehensive suite of features designed to enable the sharing of uplink resources in a structured and secure manner. These classes are part of the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), which is a channel type used for uplink transmission in 5G NR communication systems. PUSCH operates within the framework provided by the 5G NR standards, offering a specialized channel that includes the necessary functionalities and configurations for the transmission of user data in the uplink direction.\n\n- **PUSCHConfig**: This class is responsible for setting up and maintaining the configuration for a PUSCH channel. A PUSCHConfig object can be particularly helpful for users as it encapsulates various transmission and reception settings within a single instance, making it easier to manage the settings for the physical uplink shared channel in simulations or system deployments.\n\n- **PUSCHTransmitter**: The PUSCHTransmitter class is designed to simulate the actions and processes occurring at the end of the transmitter. This includes signal generation, modulation, mapping to resources, and, potentially, adding effects such as noise or fading. The exact configuration of the process is based on the PUSCHConfig object.\n\n- **PUSCHReceiver**: The PUSCHReceiver class complements PUSCHTransmitter by simulating the receiver's side of the PUSCH transmission. This class covers reception processes such as demapping demodulation, and potentially decoding. Similar to the transmitter, it operates based on the current configuration set by the PUSCHConfig instance.\n\nThrough these classes, Sionna can simulate and analyze PUSCH transmissions under different channel conditions, thus providing a tool for the research and development of uplink resource sharing as defined in the 5G NR standard. This simulation capability is useful for understanding transmission performance, channel estimation, and equalization for various communication scenarios.\n\nThe PUSCH implementation in Sionna supports various configurations that follow the 3GPP (5G) specifications. These configurations can include mappers using different modulation schemes, LDPC coding, and polarization, among other parameters, all of which can be managed with the classes outlined above.\n\n**Usage Example**:\n\nTo use the PUSCH classes, a typical workflow in Sionna would involve creating and configuring a `PUSCHConfig` instance, initializing a `PUSCHTransmitter` and a `PUSCHReceiver` with this configuration, and then using these objects for simulating the transmission and reception of a PUSCH signal over a channel. This sequence is demonstrated in the following Python code snippet, which serves as an example of how the integration and usage might look. Note that actual parameter values and configurations may differ based on system requirements and simulation conditions:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr import PUSCHConfig, PUSCHTransmitter, PUSCHReceiver\n\n# Create PUSCH configuration\npusch_config = PUSCHConfig()\n\n# Initialize PUSCH transmitter with PUSCH configuration\npusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)\n\n# Initialize PUSCH receiver with PUSCH configuration\npusch_receiver = PUSCHReceiver(pusch_transmitter)\n\n# Perform PUSCH transmit and receive simulation\n[...]  # Additional code for simulating the end-to-end PUSCH communication\n```\n\nAs a note, one must fill in the `[...]` with actual code for transmitting, receiving, and analyzing the PUSCH data, as described in the provided context and illustrated within Sionna's documentation and code examples.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe `PUSCHConfig`, `PUSCHTransmitter`, and `PUSCHReceiver` classes within Sionna's 5G NR module provide functionality to simulate the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) in 5G New Radio (NR) communication systems. These classes align with the 3GPP specifications for the 5G NR physical layer. Here's an explanation of the purpose of each class based on the context provided:\n\n1. `PUSCHConfig`: This class is responsible for configuring the PUSCH according to the simulation requirements or the 5G NR specifications. It likely contains parameters and methods to set and retrieve various properties of the PUSCH, such as modulation and coding schemes, resource block assignments, and other channel-related configurations. The class appears to be instantiated with default settings, and its properties may be adaptable to fit the specific needs of a simulation.\n\n2. `PUSCHTransmitter`: Once the PUSCH configuration is established, the `PUSCHTransmitter` class uses this configuration to simulate the transmission side of the PUSCH. This class encapsulates the process of encoding, modulating, and preparing the transmission of data over the uplink channel. It transforms input data into a format suitable for transmission over the physical channel, considering the established PUSCH configuration. In the provided code snippet, the `PUSCHTransmitter` is instantiated using the `pusch_config` and is later used to generate a transmit signal and corresponding information bits for a given batch size.\n\n3. `PUSCHReceiver`: Complementing the `PUSCHTransmitter`, the `PUSCHReceiver` class simulates the reception process of the PUSCH. This includes demodulation, decoding, and error correction to recover the transmitted information from the received signal. The class is typically designed to work in tandem with a `PUSCHTransmitter`, as indicated in the context where the `PUSCHReceiver` is created using the previously instantiated `pusch_transmitter`. The receiver processes the simulated channel output to recover the information bits and facilitate performance evaluation, such as computing the Bit Error Rate (BER).\n\nTogether, these classes form a high-level abstraction of the PUSCH-related functionalities required to simulate the uplink process in a 5G NR system. They enable users to quickly set up simulations and modify characteristics as necessary to investigate various aspects of PUSCH performance under different scenarios and configurations.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nExplain how to set up a simple flat-fading MIMO transmission simulation using the Sionna Python package.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nTo set up a simple flat-fading MIMO transmission simulation using the Sionna Python package, you'll follow a few steps. Sionna is a simulation framework for end-to-end link-level simulations of wireless communication networks, and its documentation provides ample details that we can leverage for conducting these simulations.\n\nStep 1: Model the OFDM Resource Grid\n-------------------------------------\n\nStart by creating an OFDM resource grid. Relevant settings that you will need to define include:\n\n- The number of OFDM resource *blocks* and *subcarriers* (in this example, we use 256 as defined for the 5G standard's System Bandwidth Part 1)\n- The number of OFDM symbols including the number of *pilot carriers* per OFDM symbol\n- The bit type: `sionna.ofdm.BitType.BINARY` for the purpose of this simulation (you can explore additional bit types in the Sionna documentation)\n- There are more configurations that Sionna requires around the cyclic prefix and guard interval, which are not explicitly stated in the provided context but commonly part of OFDM system design. You will need to account for these as well when setting up the simulation but will not be mentioned here given the specific constraints and information from the context.\n\nYou should create a `ResourceGrid` by specifying the above parameters:\n\n```python\nrg = sionna.ofdm.ResourceGrid(num_rb=52,  # Number of OFDM resource blocks\n                              num_carriers=12*rg.num_rb,  # Number of subcarriers\n                              num_ofdm_symbols=14,  # Number of OFDM symbols in a frame\n                              num_tx=num_tx,  # Number of transmitters for MIMO\n                              pilot_pattern=\"kronecker\",  # Set the pilot pattern\n                              pilot_data=\"nz\",  # Pilot pattern (non-zero)\n                              pilot_type=\"lte\",  # Use LTE-like pilot structure\n                              bit_type=sionna.ofdm.BitType.BINARY,  # We set the bit type to binary\n                              mapping_type=\"dl\",  # Mapping type to 'dl' as this is downlink simulation\n                              domain=\"gf\"  # Transmission domain, in frequency or time\n                              )\n```\n\nStep 2: Define Channel Model\n----------------------------\n\nYou'll then define a channel model for flat-fading conditions. Sionna offers `sionna.channel.FlatFadingChannel`, which you can use for this purpose. A simple model could look like this:\n\n```python\nchannel = sionna.channel.FlatFadingChannel(resource_grid=rg,       # OFDM resource grid\n                                           ut_speed=3.6,            # Speed of the User Terminal in km/h\n                                           num_rx=num_rx,           # Number of receivers for MIMO\n                                           los_type=\"default\",      # Line-of-sight model type\n                                           toa=\"cdm\",               # Type of arrival: CDM or \"delay\"\n                                           num_clusters=2,          # Number of clusters\n                                           num_subclusters=5,       # Number of subclusters\n                                           **rg.interpolator_args,  # Interpolator parameters\n                                           name=\"flat_fading\"       # Name of the channel model\n                                           )\n```\n\nStep 3: Generate Channel Realizations\n------------------------------------\n\nUsing the above channel model, generate channel realizations for a batch of different scenarios:\n\n```python\nchannel_realizations = channel(**rg.channel_args,      # Uses the channel model to generate realizations\n                                toa=resampling_times,   # Times of arrival for the scattering paths\n                                w,                      # MIMO transmitting weights\n                                s,                      # Stream indicators for polarization, spatial multiplexing, etc.\n                                thermal_noise[\"no\"],    # Thermal noise variances\n                              )\n```\n\nStep 4: Simulate Channel Output and Input Signal \n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSimulate the input signal at the transmitter. This involves generating signals and weights:\n\n```python\nb = sionna.utils.gemm(\"nt\", # Form output according to Rank-1 disturbance\n                      w,\n                      sionna.utils.vec(b_nz), # Weights and non-zero bit-values\n                      return_transpose=False,\n                      add_conj=False\n                      )\n```\n\nThen compute the channel output using the provided context and Sionna's helper functions:\n```python\n__ch_out, with_noise = channel_realizations(y = b, no = no, # Pass the channel model output y=b and the noise variance no\n                                             return_no = True # Flag to include the noise variance in the return tuple\n                                             )\n```\n\nAt this stage, for this simplified example, you have a flat-fading MIMO channel simulation through to the point of the OFDM resource grid. From here, you should continue your simulation by including all necessary modulation and coding steps, which are not fully detailed in the context.\n\nRemember that the rest of the simulation would typically include channel estimation, equalization, SC-FDMA (if simulating uplink), and digital-to-analog conversions, which are not within the context provided but are crucial in a complete emulated communication chain. However, these steps are built upon the OFDM resource grid setup and the channel model definition we've discussed.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo set up a simple flat-fading MIMO transmission simulation using the Sionna Python package, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Package Import**: Configure your GPU settings, if one is available, to optimize memory usage. Install and import Sionna, and suppress TensorFlow warnings.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    # Ensure Sionna is installed\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError:\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Import Utilities**: Import utility classes and functions, such as QAMSource and compute_ber, which will be needed for creating sources, channels, mappers/demappers, and for computing error rates.\n\n    ```python\n    from sionna.utils import BinarySource, QAMSource, ebnodb2no, compute_ser, compute_ber, PlotBER\n    from sionna.channel import FlatFadingChannel, KroneckerModel\n    from sionna.channel.utils import exp_corr_mat\n    from sionna.mimo import lmmse_equalizer\n    from sionna.mapping import Mapper, Demapper\n    ```\n\n3. **Create MIMO Components**: Define the MIMO components including the source, mapper, channel, and demapper. Here, we will instantiate classes for a binary source, an LDPC encoder and decoder, and a flat-fading channel with the Kronecker correlation model:\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    channel = FlatFadingChannel(num_tx_ant, num_rx_ant, spatial_corr=None, add_awgn=True, return_channel=True)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    ```\n\n4. **Channel Coding (Optional)**: To simulate coded transmissions, you can include an LDPC encoder and decoder. Here's how you could instantiate them:\n\n    ```python\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    ```\n\n5. **Transmit and Receive Data**: Generate random data, encode it, map it to symbols, and transmit the symbols over the simulated channel.\n\n    ```python\n    b = binary_source([batch_size, num_tx_ant, k])\n    c = encoder(b)\n    x = mapper(c)\n    no = ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate)\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n6. **Demap and Decode**: After transmission, apply the LMMSE equalizer, demap the received symbols, and decode them.\n\n    ```python\n    s = tf.complex(no * tf.eye(num_rx_ant), 0.0)\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n7. **Error Rate Computation**: Compute the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER) to analyze the performance of your simulation.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    ser = compute_ser(x_ind, x_ind_hat)\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    print(\"Uncoded SER : {}\".format(ser))\n    ```\n\n8. **BER Simulations with Keras Model**: For more complex simulations and tests, you can encapsulate the entire simulation process into a Keras model and perform Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n9. **Plot Results**: Finally, for visualization, use the `PlotBER` class to run simulations across different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values and plot the resulting BER curves.\n\nThe above steps form a general guideline for setting up a MIMO transmission simulation using flat-fading channels in Sionna. Each block of the simulation (e.g., source, encoder, channel, equalizer, decoder) is available as a separate component within the Sionna package, and you can customize the parameters and configurations as per your requirements.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits.

Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Below is a step-by-step guide with code examples and markdown format as instructed:\n\n**Step 1: Import Required Modules**\nFirst, you need to import the necessary modules to set up the simulation environment and for visualization:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\n**Step 2: Define Simulation Parameters**\nYou need to establish the parameters like the range of $E_b/N_0$ values and the point in a constellation, i.e., the QAM order whose BLER performance you want to analyze.\n\nFor example, $E_b/N_0$ can be computed as follows:\n\n```python\nebno_dB_sweep = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\nvariance_sweep = [(10**(ebno_dB/10.))*(reg_tx.var_per_subc*reg_tx.nb*reg_tx.num_ues)\\\n                  /(2.0*reg_tx.nb*reg_tx.attenuation_per_path_length), for ebno_dB in ebno_dB_sweep]\n```\n\n**Step 3: Run Simulations**\nYou simulate the data transmission over your MIMO-OFDM channel model configurations for different signal-to-noise ratios ($E_b/N_0$).\n\n```python\nbler_sweep = []\nnum_blocks = int(1e4*no*reg_tx.num_ofdm_syms)\n\nfor ebno, var in zip(ebno_dB_sweep, variance_sweep):\n    # Simulate to get BLER\n    bler = mc.empirical_bler(num_transmissions=num_blocks,\n                             batch_size=100,\n                             batch_eval_bler=True,\n                             constraints=[\"decoding\",\"blocking\"],\n                             validate_model=True,\n                             validate_coder=True)\n    bler_sweep.append(bler.numpy())\n```\n\n**Step 4: Plot the Results with Matplotlib**\nOnce the simulations are done, you can create a plot of $E_b/N_0$ against BLER using Matplotlib. The following code performs this task:\n\n```python\n# Plot\nplt.figure()\nplt.scatter(ebno_dB_sweep,\n            bler_sweep,\n            label=[r\"$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{E_b}{N_0}\\right)=$\"+str(ebno_dB) for ebno_dB in ebno_dB_sweep])\nplt.yscale('log')\nplt.grid(which=\"both\", linestyle=\"--\")\nplt.xlabel(r\"$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{E_b}{N_0}\\right)$\")\nplt.ylabel(\"BLER\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Step 5: Visual Nominal Configuration for Simulation**\nTo help set up and visualize your MIMO-OFDM system as mentioned, Sionna's ray-tracer module typically provides with an illustration that could be used as an example reference. This requires the import of `Visualization3D` from the `ray` module:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.rt import Visualization3D\nscene3d.nominal_configuration.visualize(profile=\"3D\",\n                                         component=Visualization3D,\n                                         rx.alignment=\"los\",\n                                         rx.show=\"antenna\",\n                                         tx.show=\"antenna\",\n                                         rx.index=None,\n                                         tx.index=None,\n                                         title=\"UEs: Green, TXs(1-3): Blue,\",\n                                         \"TX Scarf's Paths\", figsize=(10,10))\n```\n\nWith these commands, you can follow the instructions from Sionna's documentation and plot the BLER performance against $E_b/N_0$ values, while also referring to the 3D visualization of a typical setup if that is necessary.\n\nPlease ensure that you substitute the placeholder names like `mc` and `variance_sweep` with the respective real variables used in your simulation. The provided code is adapted from the context cyberian887 and reformatted to align with the instruction requirements, but internal variables and functions were previously referenced directly in the context without direct assignment or definition.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo analyze and plot the Block Error Rate (BLER) performance with respect to various $E_b/N_0$ values using Matplotlib in the context of a link-level simulation with the DeepMIMO dataset and the Sionna library, you can follow a process similar to the one outlined in the provided context. Below is an outline of the steps involved:\n\n1. **Setup Simulation Parameters**: Define a range of $E_b/N_0$ values for which the BLER will be evaluated. The code snippet suggests using NumPy's `np.linspace` to generate a linearly spaced array of $E_b/N_0$ values.\n\n2. **Run Simulations**: Use the pre-defined `LinkModel` class from the Sionna library to run link-level simulations for each $E_b/N_0$ value. This will involve encoding, modulating, applying the channel and noise, demodulating, and decoding the signal to determine the BLER at each $E_b/N_0$ point.\n\n3. **Collect Results**: As the simulations are conducted, BLER values are stored. In the given context, `sim_ber` function is used to run simulations and calculate both Bit Error Rate (BER) and BLER. Pay attention to the format of the simulation results, which include various statistics such as the number of errors, number of bits, and runtime among others.\n\n4. **Plot BLER vs. $E_b/N_0$**: Once all simulations are complete and BLER data is collected, use Matplotlib to plot the results. You create a plot with $E_b/N_0$ on the x-axis and BLER on the y-axis, using a logarithmic scale for BLER to better visualize differences across a wide range of values.\n\nHere is how you might use Matplotlib to plot the BLER based on the simulation results:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming `ebno_db` and `bler` are the arrays containing the E_b/N_0 values (in dB) and corresponding BLER results obtained from the simulation.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.semilogy(ebno_db, bler, 'o-') # Log scale for y-axis; plot with markers and lines\nplt.title('BLER Performance over $E_b/N_0$')\nplt.xlabel('$E_b/N_0$ (dB)')\nplt.ylabel('BLER')\nplt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n\n- `plt.semilogy` is used to create a semilogarithmic plot which is typical for BLER curves as they span over several orders of magnitude.\n- `plt.grid` is used to improve the readability of the plot.\n- `plt.title`, `plt.xlabel`, and `plt.ylabel` are used to label the plot and axes.\n\nRemember to replace `ebno_db` and `bler` with the actual variables containing the simulated results. If you're following the specific context provided, you would not have to run the simulation again but rather use the already obtained results from `sim_params[\"ebno_db\"]` and `bler`.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level.

This module is intended for users who are particularly interested in modeling the physical layer aspects of the uplink transmission, which is vital for understanding the behavior of 5G wireless communication systems, especially in the context of signal processing algorithm design, performance evaluations, and simulations.\n\nThe primary focus of the 5G NR module is to offer a comprehensive and fine-grained approach to replicating the intricacies of PUSCH transmissions as specified in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, which define the technical specifications for cellular 5G networks. The physical layer modules for these transmissions adopt aspects such as channel coding and modulation, multiple access methods including Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), resource grid configurations, and management of channel state information (CSI). \n\nMoreover, users of the module are provided with APIs that allow for customization and detailed control over these aspects, providing flexibility for various representation needs and research interests. For instance, the module allows the user to change the signal bandwidth, adjust the frame and subframe structure, incorporate support for channel coding and interleaving, and configure different modulation schemes.\n\nConvenience utilities are also provided to help setup simulations quickly, with features such as the `Simulator` class performing automatic setup for the required components like resource grids and communication channels. The ease of implementation demonstrated by the `Simulator` is highlighted in the context where an end-to-end uplink simulation scenario is described.\n\nMoving on to a more detailed context, the code snippet indicates how configuration and resource grids are defined within a simulation. Resource grids in 5G NR are fundamental to the scheduling and channel resource allocation, and the code:\n\n```python\nconfig = s5gnr.uplink.sim--Config() # SimConfig's radio_model args are included as well\nrg = s5gnr.uplink.PUSCHResourceGrid(config=config)\n```\n\ndemonstrates the definition of a PUSCH resource grid based on the specified simulation configuration.\n\nAdditional code further illustrates parts of the process, such as configuring a golden transmitter and generating transmission signal components, which includes data, pilots, and the DMRS.\n\nOverall, the inclusion of the 5G NR module enriches the Sionna Python package by providing a highly specific and tailored subset of functionalities that address the challenging task of simulating PUSCH in 5G NR. It allows researchers and developers working in this domain to tap into a specialized set of APIs, classes, and examples designed for advanced study and exploration of this particular feature among many others in 5G technology, promoting the further advancement of wireless communications research.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe 5G NR module in the Sionna Python package focuses on enabling simulations of 5G New Radio (NR) compliant features, with a particular emphasis on the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The PUSCH is an essential component of the 5G NR specifications as it carries user data from mobile devices to the base station. This module incorporates a subset of physical layer functionalities as specified by the 3GPP standards, specifically in the documents 3GPP TS 38.211, 38.212, and 38.214.\n\nUnderstanding the workings and performance of the PUSCH is crucial for 5G system design, as it impacts the overall network capacity, reliability, and user experience. The Sionna 5G NR module, therefore, provides users with the necessary tools, such as the `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver`, to facilitate high-level simulations of PUSCH transmissions. These tools abstract the required processing blocks for PUSCH, allowing users to easily modify them for different simulation needs.\n\nA core feature of the module is the support for the generation of demodulation reference signals (DMRS) needed for PUSCH, as well as channel estimation using least-squares (LS) estimation methods. The `PUSCHDMRSConfig` object, for example, sets parameters related to DMRS generation in various configurations, affecting the number of DMRS positions, length, scrambling identities, and other properties. Proper DMRS configuration is essential for accurate channel estimation and, subsequently, the successful demodulation of data carried by PUSCH.\n\nThe code example provided in the context shows a simple simulation setup where a `PUSCHTransmitter` is instantiated with default settings, followed by the creation of a corresponding `PUSCHReceiver`. An additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channel simulation is then performed using these components. The transmit signals and information bits are generated, passed through the channel, and finally, the receiver attempts to recover the transmitted bits. This simulation flows into a computation of the bit error rate (BER), which offers a common metric for assessing the quality of the transmission and the efficacy of the system design.\n\nIn summary, the 5G NR module in the Sionna Python package is specifically aimed at facilitating the simulation of PUSCH within 5G NR physical layer research, providing tools to model, simulate, and evaluate the performance of PUSCH transmissions in a compliant and customizable manner.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Ensure that all operations comply with the rules of TensorFlow's Graph mode and have been fully optimized.\n\n3. **AutoGraph Compatibility**: Operations in a TensorFlow Graph should be AutoGraph compatible; meaning they should be decorated with `@tf.function` or written in a way that TensorFlow can transparently convert them to Graph mode where possible.\n\n4. **Consistency with TF/Numpy**: While Sionna often follows TensorFlow's and NumPy's API conventions, it's important to note that consistency might change, and the user should carefully check the function's input requirements and behavior.\n\n5. **Data Compatibility with TensorFlow**: Ensure that the data used in the Graph mode is compatible with TensorFlow tensors. This might involve transformations or adaptors to convert Sionna's data types into TensorFlow's if they differ.\n\n6. **Input Data Types and Shape**: The function must only be fed with tensors with correct data types and shapes. Any deviation could result in graph-building errors or unexpected behavior during graph execution.\n\n7. **Testing and Debugging**: Due to the complex nature of signal processing algorithms such as parallel interference cancellation, thoroughly test and debug the `MMSE-PICDetector` function in isolation before integrating it into more complex models. This involves validating inputs, outputs, and the accuracy of the computations.\n\n8. **Memory and Performance Efficiency**: Graph mode is meant to improve execution performance of your model through pre-compilation. Optimize the use of `MMSE-PICDetector` function and any related custom operations or layers for efficient performance and memory management.\n\n9. **Caching and Model Serialization**: Use caching and serialization/deserialization techniques, like defining the function with `@tf.function`, when appropriate. This can speed up subsequent uses of the function and improve the serialization process for model saving or exporting.\n\n10. **Update TensorFlow Version Regularly**: TensorFlow and Sionna are actively developed, so make sure to update your TensorFlow version and Sionna\u2019s package to access the latest enhancements and bug fixes which may affect the use of `MMSE-PICDetector`.\n\n11. **Use of TensorFlow Import Directives**: In the context mentioned, TensorFlow's disabled CUDA log directive `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL=2` was used to suppress noisy messages related to the GPGPU and ensure consistent behavior for `MMSE-PICDetector`. Always consider environment variables and import directives that might affect the execution environment and behavior of TensorFlow.\n\nA suggested snippet demonstrating the compliance of calling `MMSE-PICDetector` with TensorFlow's `@tf.function` is shown below:\n\n```python\n@tf.function\ndef detect(channel, info_bits, sig_constel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Run the MMSE-PIC detection on the given channel and bit sequence.\n    \n    Args:\n    - channel (...)\n    - info_bits (...)\n    - sig_constel (...)\n    \n    Returns:\n    - ...\n    \"\"\"\n    # ... (implementation here)\n    \n    y_pls = channel\n    l_pll, y = sigmapper.llr_regenerator([y_pls, z_pll], no_reg, reg_params)\n    \n    # Call the MMSE-PICDetector function with @tf.function decorator\n    # output will depend on what kind of return statement was used in the MMSE-PICDetector implementation\n    return detector([y, l_pll, extra])\n```\n\nPlease adjust the function `detect` to match the interface and requirements of `MMSE-PICDetector`, as shown based on any available documentation or prior knowledge concerning Sionna's signal processing blocks. Be sure to follow this example closely, and maintain the proper balance of code efficiency and correctness for the specific environment in which it is being used.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nWhen using the MMSE-PICDetector function in Graph mode with TensorFlow, it is essential to follow certain precautions and best practices for achieving optimal performance and maintaining numerical stability. Below are some guidelines based on the context provided:\n\n1. Avoid JIT Compilation:\n   - It is mentioned in the final note that for numerical stability, using the MMSE-PICDetector function in Graph mode with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, specifically with the XLA compiler (`@tf.function(jit_compile=True)`), is not recommended. This is because some TensorFlow operations may not be fully compatible with XLA's optimizations and can lead to instability or incorrect behavior.\n\n2. XLA Compatibility:\n   - If you still need to use the function within a `@tf.function` with XLA for performance reasons, you must set `sionna.Config.xla_compat=true`. This configuration tweak is suggested to make it compatible with XLA, although it is important to carefully test the function\u2019s behavior to ensure that the desired results are achieved. Check the `xla_compat` configuration in the Sionna documentation for further details or updates related to compatibility.\n\n3. Choose Appropriate Data Types:\n   - The MMSE-PICDetector function supports different data types for the complex tensors, specifically `tf.complex64` and `tf.complex128`. The choice of data type might affect precision and computational load. Usually, `tf.complex64` will be faster but less precise than `tf.complex128`. Consider the precision requirements for your application and choose the data type accordingly.\n\n4. Handling Prior Information:\n   - The function can also accept priors on constellation symbols as an alternative to priors on the bits. Ensure that you use the format (LLRs or logits) that matches the `output` parameter specified for the detector. Incorrect prior information can result in incorrect demappings or less optimal performance.\n\n5. Parameter Configuration:\n   - Set the parameters like `output`, `demapping_method`, `num_iter`, `constellation_type`, `num_bits_per_symbol`, and `hard_out` carefully as per the requirements of your communication system and detection goals. The values of these parameters can greatly influence the detector's performance and output format.\n\n6. Input Validation:\n   - Validate the input tuples (y, h, prior, s) to ensure that they match the expected shapes and types as per the detector\u2019s API documentation. Correct shapes and types are essential for the detector's accuracy and prevention of runtime errors.\n\n7. Noise Covariance Matrix:\n   - Take special note of the noise covariance matrix `s` that the function expects, as an incorrect noise covariance matrix can lead to significant performance degradation and inaccurate detection.\n\n8. Model Verification:\n   - After configuring and running the detector, perform thorough testing and verification against known good datasets or benchmarks to ensure that the detector operates as expected.\n\n9. TensorFlow Graph Execution:\n   - Make certain that other parts of your code or model that interact with the MMSE-PICDetector are compatible with Graph mode execution. TensorFlow operations can behave differently when not running in eager mode.\n\n10. Documentation and Updates:\n   - Keep an eye on the official documentation for any updates or changes to the function usage that may occur after the knowledge cutoff date mentioned. The TensorFlow and Sionna teams could introduce changes or improvements that necessitate an update to your implementation practices.\n\nRemember, it is essential to iteratively test the system with different configurations to identify the optimal setup for your use case.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

These include:\n\n1. **LDPC Encoding & Decoding Functions:**\n   - `LDPC5GEncoder`: This is a class that implements a 5G LDPC encoder as defined by the 3GPP TS 38.212 standard. This encoder can be used for binary symmetry and for both bit and block types of LDPC codes.\n   - `LDPCBPDecoder`: This implementation of sum-product message passing (belief propagation) uses bit-node and check-node processing for both hard and log-likelihood ratio input messages. This decoder can be used for binary anti-symmetric and binary symmetry LDPC code construction types.\n\n2. **Polar Encoding & Decoding Functions:**\n   - `Polar5GGenerator`: This class is for generating information and frozen bit patterns for 5G Polar codes.\n   - `Polar5GEncoder`: This encoder is tailored for 5G Polar codes and uses a summation over codebook indices to encode k information bits into n coded bits.\n   - `PolarSCDecoder`: For successive cancellation (SC) decoding, the `PolarSCDecoder` is used. It can decode a sequence of binary encoded bits as log-likelihood ratios for the information bit using natural or verbose order and can be calm during hard decision finalization.\n   - `PolarSCListDecoder`: As an enhancement over the SC decoder, the SC list decoder can decode even when the true bit represent has values greater than one in the case of a higher constraint length. This decoder accepts soft systematic information as input and can perform the list decoding in either the frozen set or an expanded codeword depending on the chosen configurations.\n\n3. **Polar-List CD Features Functions:**\n   - `PolarCDGFactorComputation`: Although not explicitly for encoding or decoding, the `PolarCDGFactorComputation` function is used to precompute $\\mathrm{g-Sets}$, which helps in cross-decoding iterations to improve the performance of Polar decoders.\n\n**Usage Examples** (from context):\n\n### Encoding using LDPC5GNREncoder:\n\nFirst, you would need to initialize an `LDPC5GNREncoder` with the desired LDPC code rate. If no specifics are given, you will assume an arbitrary rate 1/3 for this example.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc import LDPC5GNREncoder\n\n# Initialization of the LDPC Encoder\ntx_ldpc5g_encoder = LDPC5GNREncoder(code_rate=1/3, num_codewords=1)\n```\n\n### Decoding using LDPC5GNRDecoder:\n\nTo properly decode, create an `LDPC5GNRDecoder` using the same parameters as for the encoder and select the decoder type, such as (log-)belief propagation or min-sum algorithms. Since both Polar and LDPC decoders output bit LLRs, to convert to LLRs for the hard decision, one can use the `Bool2LLR` operation.\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc import LDPC5GNRDecoder\nfrom sionna.fec.utils import Bool2LLR\n\n# Initialization of the LDPC Decoder\nldpc_decoder = LDPC5GNRDecoder(\n    code_rate=1/3,  # Assuming the code rate\n    num_codewords=1,\n    alg='belief_propagation'  # Replace with the desired algorithm (LS for aLS, MS for min-sum)\n)\n\n# Function to convert received LLRs to hard decisions\nreceived_llr2bool = Bool2LLR(hard_output=False)  # Returns hard decisions (bits) from received LLRs\n\n# Define a utility function for decoding\ndef decode_and_convert_to_bits(llrs, hard_decisions=False):\n    # LDPC Soft-Decoder\n    if hard_decisions:\n        llrs = received_llr2bool(llrs)  # Perform hard-decision decoding\n    decodable_message, valid = ldpc_decoder(llrs)\n    return decodable_message, valid\n```\n\nFor Polar codes in the Sionna package, you would follow a similar approach. There are no explicit functions or models mentioned in the context for encoding and decoding Polar codes, but the concepts of initializing an encoder and decoder for Polar codes are analogous to those for LDPC codes.\n\nFor your problem, in the given context, LDPC5GNREncoder and LDPC5GNRDecoder are used. LDPC5GNREncoder has an output_shape property which is used to specify the shape. These do not need to be further defined.\n\nThe last scenario is addressed where bool2llr and encode functions are mentioned. Not knowing specific implementation details, I can only suggest in a generalized manner. Typically, you can initialize a Polar encoder and decoder by setting up their parameters such as the Polar code rate and the type of decoding algorithm. Here's an example framework of Polar encoding and decoding setup, which would be updated with actual parameters according to the specific scenario:\n\n```python\n# Example placeholder values, substitute with actual parameters based on the problem statement.\npolar_code_rate = 1/4\npolar_encoder_type = \"...\"\npolar_decoder_type = \"...\"\npolar_encoder = PolarEncoder(code_rate=polar_code_rate, encoder_type=polar_encoder_type)\npolar_decoder = PolarDecoder(code_rate=polar_code_rate, decoder_type=polar_decoder_type)\n\n# Once your codewords are generated (binary message), you can encode it like this\ncodewords = polar_encoder(codeword_channel_message)\n\n# Decoding, which will generally produce attempted corrected code words and successful-decoding status\ndecoded_codewords, valid_decoding = polar_decoder(codewords)\n# The results will be: decoded_codewords and valid_decoding\n```\n\nAs indicated in the context, Polerscan search for the most comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the last block of the previously encoded information block. The context points to paper references for more detailed information on the code implementation and performance assessments.\n\nPlease note that in a real scenario, each encoder takes parameters based on the specific code being used and additional parameters such as input modulations, interleaving, and precoding configurations. The encoding and decoding functions would be precise implementations reflecting the physical communication layer.\n\nThe code provided in the context, despite being more focused on LDPC encoding and decoding, still gives a general structure for how one would typically define encoder and decoder in a communication system following different coding techniques (including LDPC and Polar coding).\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo perform encoding and decoding operations using LDPC and Polar codes within the Sionna package, we need to define the specific models or functions that handle these coding schemes. The followings are the essential functions or classes provided by Sionna for LDPC and Polar codes:\n\nFor **LDPC Codes**:\n1. `LDPC5GEncoder`: A class that performs the encoding operation using 5G Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. It takes parameters such as the number of information bits `k` and the length of the codeword `n`.\n\n2. `LDPC5GDecoder`: Corresponds to the LDPC decoder class, which employs an iterative belief propagation (BP) algorithm to decode LDPC codes. Again, it takes `LDPC5GEncoder` as a parameter to ensure that the decoder matches the structure defined by the encoder.\n\nExample use of LDPC encoder and decoder classes:\n```python\nn = 1000\nk = 500\nencoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\ndecoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder)\n```\n\nFor **Polar Codes**:\n1. `PolarEncoder`: A generic Polar encoder class. It can be initialized with the size of the information vector `k` and the length of the codeword `n`.\n\n2. `Polar5GEncoder`: A specialized encoder class for encoding 5G-compliant Polar codes. Similar to the `PolarEncoder`, but also incorporates CRC concatenation and rate-matching specified in 3GPP TS 38.212.\n\n3. `PolarSCDecoder`: A simple successive cancellation (SC) decoder for Polar codes, which is the most basic decoding algorithm for Polar codes.\n\n4. `PolarSCLDecoder`: An advanced decoder class that uses successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding, offering improved error correction performance over SC decoding, especially when concatenated with CRC codes.\n\n5. `Polar5GDecoder`: A decoder class that can use either the SC or SCL (or other variants such as hybrid SC/SCL) algorithms for decoding 5G-compliant Polar codes.\n\nExample use of Polar encoder and hybrid SC/SCL decoder classes:\n```python\nn = 256\nk = 128\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k, n)\n# Hybrid SC/SCL decoder with list size L\nL = 8\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder, list_size=L, algorithm=\"hybSCL\")\n```\n\nIt is important to note that `Polar5GDecoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` may have additional configuration parameters such as the list size for SCL decoding, the number of BP iterations for LDPC decoding, etc., which can be adjusted to meet the desired trade-off between decoding performance and complexity.\n\nBoth of these function sets for Polar and LDPC codes are provided as part of the FEC (forward error correction) module within Sionna. You typically create an instance of an encoder and a decoder, then invoke their respective methods to encode and decode the data.\n\nMoreover, Sionna provides utilities for code construction and simulation setup. For instance, `generate_5g_ranking` can be used to generate code construction for Polar codes according to the 5G standard, and `count_block_errors` can be used to evaluate the performance of the code by counting the number of erroneous blocks.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Given the EB/No (Noise Energy per Bit to Carrier Power Density at the receiver), add AWGN to the simulate channel output. Initialize the channel and decode the channel outputs `c`, corresponding to the transmitted channel state `c`.\n\nDuring this process, the AWGN channel and the AWGN noise power spectral density need to be taken into account.\n\n3. Compute the BER after decoding the channel outputs and compare with the bit stream generation at the transmitter to evaluate the channel's performance.\n\n4.

This code is not meant to be executed in isolation, as it relies on a broad set of functions and modules imported from the Sionna library as well as co-dependencies between various components of the project that are referenced but omitted for brevity. If you wish to execute the full simulation, you would need to make sure that your Python environment is set up to import the necessary packages such as NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, etc., and the involved Sionna components. The term BER (Binary Error Rate) signifies that the simulation quantifies the ratio of bit errors in the received signal as compared to the expected bit values, thus measuring the performance of the communication system against the AWGN channel at the specified SNR levels.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo conduct a simulation for evaluating Bit Error Rate (BER) over ray-traced channels using the context provided, you can follow these general steps which outline the process using the Sionna library:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports:**\n   Set up your GPU configuration and import the necessary libraries. Make sure TensorFlow is configured to manage the GPU memory and that Sionna is correctly imported. The relevant imports have been made in the context `[2]`.\n\n2. **Generate Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs):**\n   Once the paths have been computed from the ray-tracing, you can use those paths to create the channel impulse responses (CIRs) using the `cir` method from Sionna\u2019s ray tracing (RT) module `[14]-[17]`. Apply Doppler shifts if necessary, considering the mobility of transmitters and receivers.\n\n3. **Frequency-Domain Channel Model:**\n   Convert the time-domain CIRs to frequency-domain channels that are usable with an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system `[18]`. Adjust subcarrier frequencies and FFT sizes according to your system specifications.\n\n4. **Transmit Signal Generation:**\n   Initialize a transmitter with a `PUSCHConfig` and generate the transmit signals `[20]-[21]`.\n\n5. **Simulate Channel Output:**\n   Use the `ApplyOFDMChannel` layer to simulate the effect of the channel on the transmitted signal. Include additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) according to the specified signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in dB including noise variance `[19]-[21]`.\n\n6. **Decode Received Signals:**\n   Initialize a receiver to decode the received signal. The receiver must be compatible with the transmitter used. Use a PUSCH receiver as shown in the context `[20]-[21]`.\n\n7. **Compute BER:**\n   Calculate the BER by comparing the transmitted bit stream to the received bit stream using the `compute_ber` function. This will give you an estimate of the performance of the system over the ray-traced channels `[21]`.\n\nAn example based on the context provided would be to follow the steps outlined in snippets `[18]-[21]`, ensuring to modify parameters such as batch size, `ebno_db` (which represents the SNR in dB), and potentially other configurations to match the desired simulation scenario. The last snippet `[21]` specifically shows the steps of simulating transmissions and computing the BER, which is crucial to evaluate the performance.\n\nIf you want to perform multiple simulations across a range of SNRs to create a BER curve, you would need to loop over different `ebno_db` values, each time computing the BER and storing the results for later analysis.\n\n**Note**: The provided code snippets and descriptions are tailored to use the Sionna library specifically. If you intend to use a different software or library, the general concepts will remain the same, but the implementation details will vary accordingly.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

[{"role": "user", "content": "I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. \nYour task is to evaluate the Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. \nThe evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:\n\n1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'.

If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError:\n    !pip install sionna\n    import sionna\n```\n\nTo suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.\n\n```python\nimport os\n# Suppress Tensorflow logging\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nPlace these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    import sionna\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n    import sionna\n```\n\nThis snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

You'll want to examine how to use Sionna's provided BPDetectors, including understanding the required and optional parameters when initializing and using these detectors.\n\n2. **GP Detectors**: These are also included in Sionna for non-iterative detection. Understand how to use the GP detectors to create the non-iterative baselines. GPDetectors like MMSE (Minimum Mean-Squared Error) or ZF (Zero Forcing), which are part of this group, can be used as a reference for comparison.\n\n3. **Create and Configure Detection Models**: Implement 3GPP baseline models or customize the models to suit your simulation's requirements. This may involve selecting the detector model, its parameters such as lattice type, lattice dimension, number of streams, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) target, and other relevant settings based on the objectives of your simulations and the target channel and constellation configuration.\n\n> You can use the following code as a starting point to create a detection model in Sionna:\n```python\nclass CreateDetectionModel(gn.naming.OptimizingNameScope):\n    def __call__(self, constellation, num_streams, snr_db, detector_type=\"bp\", max_iter=10, **kwargs):\n\n        # Check that num_streams is correct (needs to be a scalar)\n        if not all([np.isscalar(n) for n in num_streams]):\n            raise ValueError(\"num_streams must be scalar\")\n\n        rho = 10.0**(snr_db/10.0)*sep.num_bits_per_symbol(constellation)\n        noise_var = 1.0 / rho * gn.noise_types.AWGN()\n        if detector_type == \"bp\":\n            # The LatticeDetectors class will automatically call the BeliefPropagation detection algorithm.\n            # detector_type=None selects the QR Processor for regular LDPC codes,\n            # which the code was not designed for according to [42].\n            return sn.detector.LatticeDetectors(constellation,\n                                                 detector_type=\"bp\",\n                                                 num_streams=num_streams,\n                                                 max_iter=max_iter,\n                                                 noise=noise_var,\n                                                 **kwargs)\n        \n        elif detector_type in [\"mmse\", \"zf\", \"sas-mmse\", \"gf-mma\", \"bpu\"]:\n            return sn.detector.LatticeDetectors(constellation,\n                                                 detector_type=detector_type,\n                                                 rank=num_streams,\n                                                 num_streams=num_streams,\n                                                 noise=noise_var,\n                                                 max_iter=max_iter,\n                                                 **kwargs)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Unknown detector type.

It might involve setting the convergence criteria to determine when the iterative process should stop.\n\n5. **Implement the Performance Metric Calculation Algorithms**:\n   Your simulation will determine and measure performance across different conditions:\n   - 3GPP Baseline performance such as PDSCH Link-Level Simulation.\n   - General Iterative Performance.\n   - Comparison of Fixed-Point Approximation methods.\n   - Iterative Detection Method against non-iterative detection.\n\n6. **Run Simulations and Output Results with Matplotlib**:\n   - Apply the set configurations and execution frequency.\n   - Record each batch's detection performance to systematically compare.\n   - Use Matplotlib to visualize the performance results, such as BER (Bit Error Rate) versus SNR, system throughput (in Mbit/s), and computational complexity or latency.\n\n7. **Interpret the Results**:\n   - Analyze the simulation results to compare the performances of the iterative and non-iterative detectors.\n   - Determine the influence of the number of iterations on the performance of iterative detectors.\n   - Assess the effect of different channel conditions, such as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) versus fading channels, on the performance of the detectors.\n   - Draw conclusions about the trade-offs in performance, latency, and complexity for the various detection methods and decoding strategies under the simulated conditions.\n\nThe provided context contains implementations and examples of much of these steps addressing the performance evaluation. To do the comparisons as mentioned, you would typically use a notebook-like framework, like the one described in the provided setup that uses TensorFlow to run the simulations and visualize results. Just make sure you adjust the parameters and configurations as needed when starting new simulations.\n\nIn the context provided, the performance evaluation is run with a defined setup using the `run_sims` function, and results are visualized using the `plot_performance_varying_num_iter` function. You should follow these functions' structure to create your own performance evaluation using different number of iterations to compare iterative and non-iterative detection schemes. \n\nThese are the key points to run an effective simulation in Sionna, with points specific as per the given context.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo construct simulations in Sionna that compare the performance of iterative and non-iterative detection methods under different channel conditions and decoding strategies, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up the Simulation Environment:**\n   - Configure the GPU or CPU settings.\n   - Import necessary Sionna components and other Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.\n   - Define the SNR range for which you want to run the simulations.\n   - Create instances of the system components such as the transmitter, channel model, detector, and decoder.\n\n2. **Configure the Channel Models:**\n   - Determine the different channel conditions you wish to simulate (e.g., perfect CSI with Rayleigh fading, estimated CSI with 3GPP UMa channels).\n\n3. **Define the Detectors:**\n   - Implement the non-iterative detection methods like LMMSE, K-Best, and EP (Expectation Propagation).\n   - Configure the iterative SISO MMSE-PIC detector.\n\n4. **Define the Decoding Strategies:**\n   - Set up iterative decoding configurations for LDPC codes, considering if the decoder state should be reset after each iteration or not (non-resetting decoder).\n\n5. **Run the Simulations:**\n   - Execute the simulations for both non-iterative and iterative detection methods across the defined SNR range.\n   - For iterative detection, run a loop where you pass `a priori` and `a posteriori` LLRs between the detector and the decoder (IDD loop).\n   - For non-iterative detection, process the detection once and pass the result to a non-iterative decoder.\n\n6. **Collect Performance Metrics:**\n   - Compute the BER (Bit Error Rate) and BLER (Block Error Rate) for each detector and decoder combination under each channel condition.\n   - Repeat the steps with varying numbers of iterations for the iterative detection methods to evaluate convergence and performance gains.\n\n7. **Analyze and Plot the Results:**\n   - Use Matplotlib to plot the BER/BLER against the SNR for each method under each channel condition.\n   - Discuss the relative performance, advantages, and trade-offs of iterative versus non-iterative methods.\n\n8. **Optimize with Machine Learning (Optional):**\n   - If you wish to explore advanced optimization methods, consider implementing the Deep-Unfolded Interleaved Detection and Decoding (DUIDD) approach which uses machine learning to tune the hyperparameters of the algorithms.\n\nWhen including code snippets, it's important to ensure they're directly relevant to the steps being described. For example, the code for configuring GPU settings, importing necessary components, and setting up the simulation environment would correspond to steps 1 and 2 above. The actual Python code for these steps may look like this (this is an adapted snippet based on your context, ensuring accuracy in transcription):\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sionna\n\n# Assuming sionna is already installed\n\n# Configure GPU settings\ngpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use CPU\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = str(gpu_num)\n\n# Set up the simulation parameters\nsnr_range = np.linspace(snr_db_min, snr_db_max, num_snr_steps)\n\n# Define other system components and functions...\n```\n\nEnsure the code provided to you is used appropriately in context to enhance clarity and accuracy of your simulation setup, while avoiding unnecessary details that might overwhelm the reader.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment.

Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled.

The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nDescribe how LLR inputs should be structured for compatibility with Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder, noting the internal representation difference.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nThe LLR (Log Likelihood Ratio) inputs provided to Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder should be structured properly to ensure compatibility. Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder, similar to other decoders in the 3GPP 5G standard, is designed to internally manage a three-bit representation of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR). Users, on the other hand, might have LLR inputs with a potentially different quantization or representation. \n\nTo ensure compatibility with Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder, these inputs should be normalized, such that an average translation from the user's representation to Sionna's intern representation is implemented. This can help in maintaining consistency and expected performance in terms of BER (Bit Error Rate) in the decoding process.\n\nFor an implementation-specific answer, users should consult the Sionna API documentation. Also, usual data types and common use cases may include passing Numpy arrays or TensorFlow tensors to the LDPC5GDecoder. If you are using a library manager, make sure you have the compatibility layer specified and use it as recommended:\n\n```python\n# Initialization using compatibility mode\n# This assumes an already opened LDPC-code conformity class as ldpc_code\n# and that yn is a LLR in the compatibility representation (float32 or float64 dtype)\n\ndecoder = s5g.mcs.LDPC5GDecoder(ldpc_code, compatibility=\"rep_int3\")\nuncoded_txb = np.random.random_sample((1, pld_batch_size//ldpc_code.k)) > 1/2\ntxb = encode(uncoded_txb) # already mapped to constellation\n\nyn = channel_output(1, tx_wave, pld_batch_size)\nun = demapper([yn, np.zeros(shape[0:2], dtype=\"complex64\")]) # assuming noise variance ebno in db\n# the 2D slice of rescaled_yn[:,:,:ldpc_nb:c], rescaled_cn is used for the codeword to ensure that we do not exceed the blocklength\n(cdout,coded_soft_output) = decoder([(un, ebno), (rescaled_yn[:,:,:ldpc_nb,:], rescaled_cn)])\n```\n\nIn case the LLR inputs are to be passed from a demapping process, it is important to understand the expected input structure and shape that Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder requires. Users should ensure that they provide the LLR inputs with the correct dimensions according to their needs where, for example with bitmap = True, it could be:\n\n```python\nshape = encoder.compute_shape(\"bai\",bitmap=True)\nprefixed_tx_wave.shape[0] == shape[0]\npld_batch_size == shape[-1]\n# the code is defined that we transmit the codeword without any additional information bits. Therefore the codeword-could-broadcast-mask is equivalent to the information-bits-broadcast-mask\n# in this case we are left with codeword with only efficiency or all-zero codeword or codewords. Let us demap in this case \nc_wo_info = uncoded_txb\nc_wo_info=L.HDPCConverse(c_wo_info, compute_inform=True)\n[key_indices,key_source_info] = c_wo_info\nun = demapper([yn,ln,np.zeros(shape[0:2],dtype=\"complex64\")]) # assuming noise variance ebno in db\n# the 2D slice of rescaled_yn[:,:,:ldpc_nb:c] is used for the codeword to ensure that we do not exceed the blocklength\n([llr_ll,llr_ab,llr_cw_map,llr_full,coded_soft_output,llr_source_info]) = decoder([([un,ebno,rescaled_yn[:,:,:ldpc_nb,:]],(ebno,shape[:3],rescaled_y[:,:,:ldpc_nb,:],no,shape[-1],shape[-1],iinfo_elems_per_codeword,info_indices))])\n```\n\nTo correctly structure LLR inputs with the proper internal representation (constrained to three bits) for Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder, one could consider normalizing the LLR values by dividing by a factor such as 2, so they fall within the range defined by the internal representation. Doing so will ensure efficient decoding and will maintain compatibility with the decoder's expectations.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo ensure compatibility with Sionna's LDPC5GDecoder, the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) inputs need to be structured properly, taking into account the internal representation difference. As per the documentation, the inputs to the LDPC5GDecoder are assumed to be in the form of LLRs representing the logarithm of the ratio of probabilities, \\(\\log(p(x=1)/p(x=0))\\). However, the internal processing within the LDPC5GDecoder uses an LLR definition of \\(\\log(p(x=0)/p(x=1))\\).\n\nGiven this difference, when you provide LLRs to the LDPC5GDecoder, make sure they follow the expected convention of \\(\\log(p(x=1)/p(x=0))\\). The decoder handles the conversion internally. Note that the decoder will also clip the LLRs to the range of +/- 20 for numerical stability.\n\nWhen passing the LLRs to the decoder, ensure that they are structured as a 2D tensor (or higher dimensionalities) with the shape [..., n], where 'n' is the number of codeword bits (output length of the LDPC code). If using batch processing, the batch size would be the leading dimension.\n\nTo illustrate, in Python code using TensorFlow as the underlying framework:\n\n```python\n# Assuming llr represents log-likelihood ratios from the demapper\n# and has shape [..., n] as required by the decoder\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nIn this example, `llr` is the input tensor containing the LLRs structured correctly for the decoder.\n\nIf the decoder is set to `stateful=True`, the input should be a tuple `(llrs_ch, msg_vn)` where `msg_vn` is either None or a RaggedTensor of variable node messages from the previous decoding iteration. But this additional input is only necessary when the decoder's statefulness is being leveraged, as in the case of iterative demapping and decoding scenarios.\n\nRemember to adjust the input LLRs to the expected representation before passing them to the LDPC5GDecoder for accurate decoding.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

However, it's essential to note that there is no direct mention of such a function in the provided context. Assuming such a function exists and its usage is similar to other parts of the Sionna library, the procedure would be as follows:\n\nFirst, you would import the `complex2real_channel` function from the Sionna library if it's available. If the function is not explicitly mentioned in the given context, there may be another means to convert complex MIMO channels to their real-valued counterparts in the library without an explicit `complex2real_channel` function. Given the instructions to use its real-valued input and output counterparts, let's assume those are `sx`, `sz`, `v` for example. The explanation will be according to these hypothetical conventions.\n\nHere's a hypothetical usage assuming the function `complex2real_channel` to converting a complex MIMO channel, where `H` is a complex MIMO channel of shape `[batch_size, output_dim, input_dim]`. Also, `sx` is the cross-entropy of the Gaussian distribution after the complex-to-real transformation, and `v` the respective precoded noise:\n\n```python\nimport sionna\n\n# Assuming 'H' is a complex-valued MIMO channel with dimensions [batch_size, output_dim, input_dim]\nH_real, c, sx, sz, v = sionna.channel.complex2real_channel(H, return_sx=True, return_c=True, return_sz=True, return_v=True)\n```\n\nThis function would return the following:\n\n- `H_real`: The real-valued channel, which would typically have a shape of `[batch_size, output_dim, 2*input_dim]`, where the last dimension accounts for the real and imaginary parts of the input.\n- `c`: The bias that is added when converting complex to real-valued (and removed in the subsequent downlink system). Its shape is `[batch_size, output_dim, 2*input_dim, 2]` representing the real and imaginary parts for input and output together.\n- `sx`: The cross-entropy of the Gaussian distribution after the complex-to-real transformation. If the cross-entropy of the zero-mean complex Gaussian distribution after the transformation is required, set the `return_sx=True`.\n- `sz`: The new effective channel noise variance. Its shape would be `[batch_size, output_dim, 2*input_dim, 2*input_dim]`.\n- `v`: The respective precoded noise as adjusted to match the new variance of the effective channel noise.\n\nPlease note, this answer is given under the assumptiom that a `complex2real_channel` function is part of the Sionna library. If such function does not exist in the current version of the library or if functionality is addressed elsewhere, it would be inappropriate to use the explained code. \n\nIt's always best to refer to the official Sionna library documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information on Sionna's API and for finding out if actual procedure and function names matching the asked context.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo transform a complex MIMO channel into its real-valued form using the `complex2real_channel` function in Sionna, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure that you have the complex-valued representations of the MIMO channel\u2019s received signal vector, the channel matrix, and the noise covariance matrix. Let these be represented as tensors `y` (for the received signal vector), `h` (for the channel matrix), and `s` (for the noise covariance matrix).\n\n2. Make sure that the input tensors follow the expected dimensionalities:\n   - `y` should have dimensions `[\u2026, M]` where `M` is the number of receive antennas.\n   - `h` should have dimensions `[\u2026, M, K]` where `K` is the number of transmit antennas.\n   - `s` should have dimensions `[\u2026, M, M]`.\n\n3. Import the necessary module from Sionna and utilize the `complex2real_channel` function with `y`, `h`, and `s` as the inputs:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.mimo import complex2real_channel\n\n# Let's assume y, h, s are already defined tensors with the correct dimensions\n# and complex data types as per the given context.\n\n# Now, transform the complex-valued channel to its real-valued equivalent.\ny_real, h_real, s_real = complex2real_channel(y, h, s)\n```\n\n4. The function `complex2real_channel` will return three tensors representing the real-valued equivalents of the input tensors. These will be:\n   - `y_real` with dimensions `[\u2026, 2M]`\n   - `h_real` with dimensions `[\u2026, 2M, 2K]`\n   - `s_real` with dimensions `[\u2026, 2M, 2M]`\n\nEach of these tensors are now in a form suitable for use with MIMO detection algorithms that require real-valued inputs.\n\nKeep in mind that the dimensions represented by the ellipsis (`[\u2026]`) in the input tensors allow for any leading dimensions that your specific use case might have (such as batch size, time steps, etc.), so the output will preserve these leading dimensions as well.\n\nMake sure you have Sionna installed and properly set up in your working environment to execute the above Python code.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points.

Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level.

It achieves this by appending a predetermined number of parity bits (redundant bits used for error-checking) to a block of data. The CRC algorithm computes a series of parity-check equations for the entire block based on polynomial division, resulting in a checksum that is sent alongside the data.\n\n**Parity Bits Functions**\n\nParity bits help in error detection by providing a mechanism to validate the integrity of the data. When the receiver computes the parity bits using the same CRC algorithm, it expects to obtain a particular result. If the received parity bits do not match the expected value, the receiver can infer that errors must have been introduced into the data during transmission.\n\n- **Computation**: The receiver computes the CRC using the entire received data block, including the appended parity bits. If there are no errors during transmission, which would alter the data and its length, the computed CRC should match the remainder that was sent along with the data. Thus, the parity bits serve as a checksum, acting as a fingerprint of the data's integrity.\n\n- **Detection**: If the computed CRC at the receiver side does not match the received CRC, the receiver will know that an error occurred and indicate that the data is no longer trustworthy. This technique can detect the additional errors or correctable errors as per the CRC length.\n\nThe CRC is designed to detect a certain maximum number of errors within a given range of bits that are changed or lost due to channel conditions. Its error detection capability is dictated by the properties defined by the generator polynomial used to generate the CRC code. For example, the code in `crc4bits = keras_model_utils.crc24a(\"4b1\"))` from Keras model is based on the 24A (or Parity-4) code specified in 3GPP, but the user can set the protection level as \"4b1\", \"4b10\", \"10b10\".\n\nIn practical terms, parity bits aren't foolproof; they can flag the presence of errors, but they don't pinpoint where the error happened. Thus, CRC is combined with retransmissions or error correction mechanisms to correct errors. In the context of wireless communications simulations, CRC can be applied to detect errors in the received data after demodulation and decoding, thereby enabling an assessment of the performance of error-correcting codes in complex communication scenarios.\n\n**Correlation to Sionna Simulation**\n\nIn the Sionna simulation, the 24A is used implicitly for EMGTC LDPC codes. Simulation results included plotting the BLER (Block Error Rate) as a function of the coding rate, which essentially measures how many errors in a data block are detected by the CRC. Since higher coding rates have fewer parity bits, error correction performance diminishes, as would be expected when the number of detectable errors is reduced. For instance, the plot `plot_blers.html` code snippet illustrates that under certain conditions such as high interleaver depth, the BLER can increase sharply as the coding rate reaches rates over 50%, which indicates a diminished ability to detect or correct errors using the same CRC mechanism.\n\nThis shows that the CRC performed as expected, detecting the presence of errors but not always having the ability to rectify them in the observed channel conditions and coding schemes, reminding us that it's only one component of a robust error detection and correction system.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nCyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a technique used to detect errors in digital data. It adds parity bits to the data to help in error detection. The way CRC works is that it treats the data as a long polynomial and divides it by a preset, known polynomial (the CRC polynomial). The remainder from this division becomes the parity bits, also known as the CRC code. These parity bits are then appended to the end of the data sequence.\n\nWhen the combined sequence of data and CRC code is sent over a transmission medium, the receiver can check for errors by performing the same division process. If the remainder (or the CRC) of this division is not zero, then it indicates that the data has been corrupted during transmission. In such a case, the receiver would know that some form of error has occurred.\n\nThe parity bits in a CRC are specifically designed based on the chosen CRC polynomial. CRC polynomials come in various sizes like CRC-6, CRC-11, CRC-16, CRC-24, etc., with the number indicating the length of the CRC code. Each standard, such as the 3GPP standard for 5G NR (New Radio), specifies which CRC polynomials to use.\n\nIn order to use CRC in practice, we create instances of `CRCEncoder` and `CRCDecoder`. The `CRCEncoder` adds the CRC parity bits to the data to produce a codeword. Here is an example of how the `CRCEncoder` is used:\n\n```python\nencoder = CRCEncoder(crc_degree=\"CRC24A\")  # Chooses the CRC polynomial CRC24A\n```\n\nThis code creates a CRC encoder instance with a polynomial defined by the standard CRC24A. The `crc_degree` parameter specifies the number of parity bits added to the data, indicating that there will be 24 parity bits for error detection.\n\nWhen the receiver gets this data, they can run the `CRCDecoder` to check if the data is corrupted:\n\n```python\nu_hat, crc_valid = decoder(c)\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, `decoder` is an instance of `CRCDecoder`, and `c` contains the transmitted data along with CRC parity bits. The decoder checks the validity of the data and returns the original data (`u_hat`) without parity bits, and `crc_valid`, which is a boolean indicating if the CRC check passed or failed.\n\nTo sum up, parity bits in a CRC allow error detection by having both the sender and receiver follow a predefined algorithm involving polynomial division. Any discrepancy in the resulting parity bits between the sender and receiver signals that an error has occurred, enabling the detection of such errors.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nDemonstrate how to compute the normalized Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of a tensor using the \"fft\" and \"ifft\" functions, respectively, within Sionna.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nTo compute the normalized Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of a tensor using the `fft` and `ifft` functions within Sionna, you can follow the example below:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport sionna as sn\nfrom sionna.utils import next_pow_of_2\n\n# Assuming you have a tensor 'x' that you want to transform\n# Compute the length of the FFT/IFFT\nn = x.shape[-1]\n# Calculate the next power of 2 (as required by the FFT/IFFT functions) and adjust shape accordingly\nn_pad = next_pow_of_2(n) \nx = tf.pad(x, [[0,0]]*(len(x.shape)-1) + [[0, n_pad-n]])\n\n# Compute the forward FFT (DFT) on the tensor 'x'\nx_f = sn.fft(x, norm=\"ortho\") # Set norm to \"ortho\" for normalized FFT\n\n# Compute the backward IFFT (IDFT) on the result 'x_f'. \n# Note that to change back to the original shape, you need to use shape slicing (e.g. x_hat to remove the padding)\nx_hat = sn.ifft(x_f, norm=\"ortho\")\nx_hat = x_hat[..., :n] # Slicing to restore the original shape\n```\n\nIn the provided Python code, the process can be broken down into the following steps:\n1. `next_pow_of_2(n)`: This function allows you to calculate the next power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the input, `n`, which is required for the efficient FFT/IFFT operations.\n2. Padding the input: Here, the input tensor is padded to the next FFT/IFFT friendly size so that the functions can operate correctly. Slicing is then used to recover the original shape.\n3. `sn.fft(x, norm=\"ortho\")`: This computes the normalized DFT of 'x', and the `norm=\"ortho\"` parameter ensures that the normalization factors are applied during FFT. This is necessary because DFT algorithms are often implemented in a way that add intra-normalization.\n4. `sn.ifft(x_f, norm=\"ortho\")`: The result, 'x_f', is then passed to the IFFT function to carry out the inverse transformation, recovering an approximation of the original input.\n\nIt is important to note that `fft` and `ifft` functions in Sionna expect a tensor with a certain shape, and for proper inversion, `norm=ortho` must be used consistently for both operations to ensure matching normalization and provide the correct inverse. Additionally, padding and slicing of the tensors are important to ensure the returned signal matches the input signal in length.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nIn the context provided, there is no direct mention of functions named `fft` or `ifft` within the Sionna library. Usually, these terms refer to the fast Fourier transform and its inverse, which are common operations in signal processing and are used to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) efficiently.\n\nGiven the lack of specific references to `fft` or `ifft` in Sionna, I will thus provide a general explanation of how one would compute the normalized DFT and IDFT using conventional methods in libraries that closely resemble Sionna's typical dependencies, like TensorFlow or Keras. However, please be aware that Sionna might have its own dedicated functions for these operations which should be preferred if they exist.\n\nIn TensorFlow, which is typically used alongside or as an underlying framework for libraries like Sionna, you can use `tf.signal.fft` for the DFT and `tf.signal.ifft` for the IDFT. Here is a demonstration of how you would use these functions to compute the normalized DFT and IDFT of a tensor:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assume `x` is a complex tensor representing your signal/time-domain samples\nx = tf.constant([...], dtype=tf.complex64)\n\n# Compute the normalized DFT (FFT)\ndft = tf.signal.fft(x) / tf.sqrt(tf.cast(tf.size(x), tf.float32))\n\n# `dft` now contains the frequency-domain representation of `x`\n\n# Compute the normalized IDFT (IFFT) to reconstruct the original signal\nidft = tf.signal.ifft(dft) * tf.sqrt(tf.cast(tf.size(x), tf.float32))\n\n# `idft` should be approximately equal to `x` if there is no numerical error\n\n# Real-world usage may need further adjustments such as windowing, zero-padding, etc.\n```\n\nKey points in the code example:\n- `tf.constant([...])` is where you would define your input tensor (time-domain samples).\n- The DFT is normalized by dividing by the square root of the number of elements in `x`, which is obtained using `tf.size(x)`.\n- Similarly, the IDFT is normalized by multiplying by the same factor.\n\nPlease consult the Sionna documentation or source code for exact usage within that library, as the actual function names or methods may differ slightly or offer additional capabilities suited for communication systems simulation. If Sionna has its own specialized fft and ifft functions closely integrated with its models and simulations, they should be used in place of TensorFlow's to ensure compatibility and optimal performance within the context of the library's ecosystem.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Below is a discussion of the benefits of Sionna in relation to its ease of scaling to multi-GPU simulations and the availability of the TensorBoard debugging features.\n\n### Multi-GPU Scalability in Sionna:\n\n**Background:**\nSionna is a wireless communication simulation library that's designed to be highly performant and suitable for a range of research applications. It's built on top of TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library renowned for its robustness and GPU acceleration capabilities. One of the key challenges in simulation environments is to scale efficiently as the complexity of the models, or the amount of data being processed, increases.\n\n**Ease of Scaling using Multiple GPUs:**\nSionna enables simulations to be efficiently distributed across multiple GPUs, allowing researchers to leverage their resources for speed and scale. Specifically, in training, Sionna can handle synchronous distributed training, which allows you to spread the computation over numerous devices, enabling you to train on large datasets in the minimum time.\n\n- Synchronous Training ([Source](https://ionna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sionna.dl.html#sionna.dl.NoisyE2ETrainer)): Sionna's NoisyE2ETrainer simplifies multi-GPU training by automatically setting up mirrored strategies that distribute the training across GPUs. Users only need to specify how many GPUs they have, and the trainer will take care of the rest.\n\n**Benefits of Multi-GPU Usage:**\n- **Performance:** by parallelizing calculations across multiple GPUs, Sionna can significantly speed up training times, making Model development and experimentation more efficient and less time-consuming.\n- **Handling Large Datasets:** Multi-GPU support is essential when dealing with large datasets that exceed the memory capacity of a single GPU or CPU. The dataset can be split across multiple GPUs, allowing training on the complete dataset without setting complex custom pipelines or memory optimizations.\n\n### TensorBoard Debugging in Sionna:\n\n**Background:**\nTensorBoard is integrated into TensorFlow and provides a suite of tools for tracking and visualizing metrics such as performance, graph visualization, and histograms during training and after the model is built. It is an essential tool for model development and debugging in machine learning and deep learning projects.\n\n**TensorBoard in Sionna:**\n- The Sionna library includes easy-to-use features for integrating the visualization capabilities of TensorBoard: Users can create *SummaryWriter* objects as part of their project, which allows them to immediately create visualizations for metrics, histograms, and images using a few lines of code.\n\n**Benefits of TensorBoard Usage with Sionna:**\n- **Debugging and Optimization:** The use of TensorBoard provides an interactive environment for model debugging by observing model metrics at runtime, which is a critical aid in the optimization of model performance and quality.\n- **Insight:** Visualizations, such as histograms, weight distributions, and model architectures, can provide valuable insights for understanding and refining a model.\n- **Comparative Analysis:** TensorBoard can help compare the training, validation, and testing performance across different runs, facilitating model development and deployment.\n\nIn summary, Sionna's integration with TensorFlow and the related capabilities it inherits such as multi-GPU scalability and built-in TensorBoard support contribute greatly to its utility and appeal for wireless communication researchers and engineers. Both features enhance productivity and enable efficient model development, data exploration, and troubleshooting.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nSionna is an open-source library that provides tools for simulating and learning end-to-end communication systems, particularly in the context of neural networks. Two of the notable benefits of using Sionna for such simulations are its ease of scaling to multi-GPU environments and the availability of TensorBoard for debugging.\n\n**Ease of Scaling to Multi-GPU Simulations**\n\nOne of the primary benefits of Sionna is its simplicity in scaling up simulations to run across multiple GPUs. In the realm of neural network training and complex simulations, the ability to distribute the workload effectively across several GPUs is crucial for reducing computation time and increasing the efficiency of the overall process.\n\nWhen using Sionna, scaling to multiple GPUs is made straightforward, often with minimal additional code, leveraging TensorFlow's built-in support for distributed training. TensorFlow can handle the distribution of the compute operations and the necessary communication between different GPU devices. This means users can focus more on the design and training of their machine learning models rather than the intricacies of parallel computation.\n\n**Availability of TensorBoard for Debugging**\n\nAnother significant advantage of using Sionna is the integration with TensorBoard, TensorFlow's visualization toolkit. TensorBoard provides a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding the internals of TensorFlow runs and graphs. When working with complex neural networks and simulations such as those provided by Sionna, having an effective debugging tool is essential for:\n\n1. Monitoring training processes in real-time, allowing users to visualize metrics like loss and accuracy, which are key to understanding the performance of the model.\n2. Understanding the computation graph, helping to debug the network architecture, and ensuring that all components of the network are connected correctly and functioning as intended.\n3. Profiling TensorFlow programs, providing insights into resource usage and performance bottlenecks, which is especially important when training on multiple GPUs where optimization can significantly impact training time and costs.\n\nIncorporating TensorBoard into Sionna's workflow allows for easier identification of issues and accelerates the process of iterating and improving communication systems models. It helps in fine-tuning the model parameters and architecture by giving clear insights obtained from the visualizations.\n\nIn conclusion, Sionna's ability to scale to multi-GPU simulations combined with the powerful debugging capabilities offered by TensorBoard makes it a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working on advancing machine learning in communication systems. These features help reduce the time required to train models and ease the process of identifying and resolving issues that may arise during the development of complex neural receivers and other components of communication systems.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nDemonstrate configuring a PUSCHTransmitter to generate time-domain outputs and display the shape of the resulting output signal.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nTo configure a `PUSCHTransmitter` in Sionna for NR (New Radio) communication system simulations, and generate its time-domain output, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary components from Sionna:\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n   from sionna.nr import PUSCHTransmitter, PUSCHConfig, BandwidthPart\n   ```\n\n2. Set up the simulation environment and parameters. In the context given, this is done by creating an instance of `PUSCHConfig`. For this demonstration, assume `pusch_config` is an instance of PUSCHConfig with the appropriate parameters configured.\n\n3. Instantiate a `BandwidthPart` based on the `pusch_config`:\n   ```python\n   bw_part = BandwidthPart(pusch_config, \"pusch\")\n   ```\n\n4. Create an instance of `PUSCHTransmitter` for generating fake transmitted data:\n   ```python\n   pusch_generator = PUSCHTransmitter(bw_part)\n   ```\n\n5. Set the training signal presence to as required:\n   ```python\n   pusch_generator._train_seq = 'nz'\n   ```\n\n6. Generate the PF (Physical Format) for the PUSCH transmission, assuming an input data shape of `[b, 1, n_re]`, where `b` is the batch size, `1` is the number of layers (for a single-layer simulation), and `n_re` is the number of resource elements.\n   ```python\n   pf = pusch_generator.pf(input_shape=[None, 1, 132])\n   ```\n\n7. Finally, pass the PF for time-domain signal generation and get the output signal along with the resource grid, which holds the modulated QAM symbols:\n   ```python\n   s_time, x_rv = pusch_generator.time(sig_pf)\n   ```\n\n8. Display the shape of the transmitted time-domain signal.\n   ```python\n   print(\"The dimensions of the transmitted time domain signal s_time is:\", s_time.shape)\n   ```\n\nThe context does not contain the explicit shape of the transmitted signal output `s_time`. However, assuming typical values for NR PUSCH time-domain signals, the shape might be something like `[batch_size, num_ofdm_symbols, num_samples_per_symbol]`. This shape can be printed for the actual output signal using the above `print` statement.\n\nPlease note that the `bw_part` instance of `BandwidthPart` should be created based on the `pusch_config`. This `bw_part` instance is crucial for setting up the input shape of the `PUSCHTransmitter` as it provides the required parameters to configure the bandwidth and subcarrier spacing.\n\nAlso, the `_train_seq` attribute in Step 5 is presumed to inform the PUSCHTransmitter whether to generate training sequences. Setting it to `'nz'` typically means no training sequences are to be used. In the actual implementation of the 5G NR 38.214 specifications, codeword generation types (with or without data) might be handled differently. \n\nFinally, the configuration of the `pusch_config` relies on the specific constraints for Numerology, frequency-hopping, and cyclic prefix. Adjusting these parameters may lead to variations in the time-domain signal output, and methods such as `uplink_resource_grid()` can be used from the `pusch_config` class to work with the resource grid for the PUSCH transmission.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo configure a `PUSCHTransmitter` from the Sionna library to generate time-domain outputs, you can set the `output_domain` parameter to `\"time\"` during the initialization of the `PUSCHTransmitter` object. Here's an example of how to do this and how to display the shape of the resulting output signal:\n\n```python\n# Assume that the PUSCHTransmitter configurations 'pusch_config' and 'pusch_config_1'\n# have been previously defined as per the context provided.\n\n# Create a PUSCHTransmitter with time-domain output\npusch_transmitter_time = PUSCHTransmitter([pusch_config, pusch_config_1],\n                                          output_domain=\"time\",\n                                          return_bits=False)\n\n# Simulate transmission by providing previously generated bits 'b' as input\n# It is assumed 'b' has been generated in the previous steps shown in the context.\nx_time = pusch_transmitter_time(b)\n\n# Print the shape of the time-domain output signal\nprint(\"Shape of time-domain output x_time:\", x_time.shape)\n```\n\nAfter running this Python snippet, the variable `x_time` will contain the time-domain representation of the transmitted OFDM waveform for each transmitter. The shape of `x_time` is printed to the console which will indicate the dimensions of the generated time-domain signal.\n\nThe last dimension of `x_time` corresponds to the number of time-domain samples. The total number of time-domain samples can be calculated by multiplying the cyclic prefix length and the FFT size by the number of OFDM symbols in the resource grid, as shown in this calculation from the context:\n\n```python\nnum_time_samples = (pusch_transmitter.resource_grid.cyclic_prefix_length +\n                    pusch_transmitter.resource_grid.fft_size) *\n                    pusch_transmitter.resource_grid.num_ofdm_symbols\n\nprint(num_time_samples)\n```\n\nThis calculation should match the last dimension of `x_time.shape` that we printed earlier.\n\nTo visualize the time-domain output signal, you can use a plotting library like Matplotlib:\n\n```python\n# For demonstration, let's plot the first time-domain output signal\n# for the first transmitter and the first antenna\n\n# Select the signal to plot\nsignal_to_plot = x_time[0,0,0,:]\n\n# Plot the real part of the time-domain signal\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))\nplt.plot(np.real(signal_to_plot), label='Real part')\nplt.plot(np.imag(signal_to_plot), label='Imaginary part')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Time-Domain Output Signal')\nplt.xlabel('Time Sample')\nplt.ylabel('Amplitude')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis will display the real and imaginary parts of the selected waveform, providing a visual representation of the shape of the output signal in the time domain.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The middle score in the limited correctness level.(1-3 points)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Describe how to implement the OFDMSystem class as a Keras model, including conditions for using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistance's Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in the context of Sionna, one must carefully design the model to reflect the structure and functionality of the OFDM-based MIMO channel estimation and equalization. The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Also, create and configure ApplyChannel instances.\n\n6. **Build the TensorFlow Model:**\n   Write a custom model inheriting from `keras.Model` and define the call method, simulating a round trip transmission with noise, fading and MIMO analysis. For different MIMO detectors, have conditionals to apply the desired detection method.\n\n   Below is a high-level example of how this could look using MIMO detection with Minimum Mean Square Error\n   (MMSE) or Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC):\n\n   ```python\n   class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):\n       def __init__(self, max_num_users=3, mode=\"mmse\"):\n           super().__init__()\n           [System setup code here]\n           self.mode = mode  # MIMO detector mode, either \"sdd/sic\" or \"mmse\"\n\n       @tf.function\n       def call(self, pusch_config):\n          # pusch_config object holds the transmission parameters - MCS, bandwidth, number of resource blocks, etc.\n          [Other calls and definitions as required]\n          [Instantiations of transmitter, receiver, etc.]\n          [Building and calling the model loop]\n\n   # Set parameters and detector mode\n   mimo_mmse_model = MyModel(max_num_users=2, mode=\"mmse\")\n   mimo_sic_model = MyModel(max_num_users=3, mode=\"sdd/sic\")\n   ```\n\n7. **Configure and Run the Model:**\n   Create model instances and run simulations by calling the end-to-end model with different system parameters as input.\n\n   ```python\n   # Scenario setup (SIC is usually more robust to user estimates, where we assume they are too reliable)\n   pusch_config = PUSCHConfig(snrdB=i-5, mcs=\"cqi_7\", rb_num=10, mimo_model=\"matern53\",\n                              use_3pilots_for_channel_estimation=True)\n\n   with tf.device([gpu0, gpu1, ...]):\n       # Run a back and forth simulation\n       if mimo_mmse_model.mode == \"mmse\":\n           y_hat, user_snis, y_hat_shape = mimo_mmse_model([pusch_ue, 1.e-5])\n       else:\n           y_hat, user_snis, y_hat_shape = mimo_sic_model([pusch_ue, 1.e-5])\n   ```\n   \n   Using this setup, the model's output `y_hat` would contain estimates of the resource grid signals, `user_snis` the per-user SNIs, and `y_hat_shape` the estimated resource grid signal shape. Depending on your requirement, post-processing of these outputs such as the calculation of Bit Error Rate (BER) might be necessary.\n\nRemember to adjust the actual provided code from Sionna and these steps accordingly for our specific simulation task and for the exact end-to-end model you wish to create, including the specifics of the uplink or downlink channels and system parameters.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo define an end-to-end model in TensorFlow that simulates PUSCH transmissions over a site-specific channel in Sionna, the following steps are involved:\n\n1. **Setup and configuration**: Configure the simulation environment with appropriate system parameters such as subcarrier spacing, number of time steps, number of users (num_tx), number of receivers (num_rx), and the number of antennas on the transmitters and receivers (num_tx_ant and num_rx_ant respectively).\n\n2. **Transmitter configuration**: Setup the basestation (e.g. `Transmitter` instance in Sionna) with a specific antenna configuration. Use ray-tracing to simulate the site-specific channel.\n\n3. **Receiver configuration**: Define the user equipment (UE) as receivers (e.g. `Receiver` instances in Sionna), each with an antenna array configuration. Sample positions for the receivers within the coverage area.\n\n4. **Channel Impulse Response (CIR) simulation**: Run the ray-tracing simulation to generate CIRs for random user positions. Consider channel reciprocity to simulate uplink direction.\n\n5. **Data generation**: Implement a generator to sample CIRs for the different transmitters and stack them into a single tensor using the `CIRGenerator` class.\n\n6. **OFDM channel model creation**: Utilize `CIRDataset` to create a channel model to be used with the `OFDMChannel` layer.\n\n7. **Transmitter and Receiver layers**: Define the `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver` layers using Sionna's existing components, with the desired configurations for the 5G NR PUSCH system.\n\n8. **MIMO detector selection**: Include an option to select different MIMO detectors like Linear Detector (LMMSE) or K-Best Detector.\n\n9. **End-to-end model construction**: Assemble the above components into an end-to-end TensorFlow model (e.g. `Model` class), configuring it with desired parameters such as batch size, Eb/No, and detector type.\n\n10. **Simulation and evaluation**: Run simulations over various configurations and plot the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER).\n\nTo get a practical view, here is an abstract Python code structure to define such an end-to-end model:\n\n```python\nclass Model(tf.keras.Model):\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        # Initialize components like channel model, PUSCH transmitter and receiver, etc.\n        ...\n        # Depending on the detector type, instantiate the corresponding detector\n        if detector == \"lmmse\":\n            self.detector = LinearDetector(...)\n        elif detector == \"kbest\":\n            self.detector = KBestDetector(...)\n        ...\n\n    def call(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Run the end-to-end transmission simulation using PUSCH over the channel model\n        ...\n        return b, b_hat\n```\n\nThe actual code within the methods would follow the example given in the provided context, using the Sionna library\u2019s API for defining transmitter and receiver settings, performing ray tracing, setting up the channel model, and other operations necessary to configure and run the simulations.\n\nKeep in mind that the above structure is an abstraction and will need to be filled with the specifics mentioned in the provided context. The context code snippets for initializing the transmitter, receiver, and other components should be incorporated appropriately into the methods of this end-to-end simulation class. Also, ensure that the TensorFlow model is compatible with the specific versions of Sionna and TensorFlow in use.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

This likely involves setting up the Sionna add-on for Blender. While the exact installation instructions are not given in the context, it is common to install Blender add-ons through the Blender preferences menu under the \u201cAdd-ons\u201d section.\n\n3. **Use Python to Automate Processes**: Leverage Blender\u2019s Python scripting capabilities to automate complex tasks such as scene creation. The context provided mentions that Python can be used to generate scenes after importing the floor map and cell layout using the Sionna add-on.\n\n4. **Work with Sionna for Scene Setup**: Sionna's radio components will be used within the scene to configure ray tracing simulations. The code examples in the context demonstrate setting up transmitter and base station models for scene rendering.\n\n5. **Render the Scene in Mitsuba 3**: After the scene is set up in Blender using Sionna's tools, you can send the scene to Mitsuba 3 for rendering. This step is handled by Python scripts within Blender. The rendered images showing different propagation paths can be visualized, analyzed, and used for bit error rate (BER) computation within the context of wireless communication research performed with Sionna.\n\n6. **Integrate Results into Workflow**: The rendered images and the PropagationRenderer class from Sionna, as referenced in the provided context, are then used within the MC-CDMA simulation workflow, leveraging Sionna's functionalities such as Model and OFDMTransmitter.\n\nAlthough the specifics of the Python script to generate scenes and the integration with Mitsuba 3 are not directly provided in the snippet, the features and capabilities of the tools required for the process are described. You would use a combination of the Sionna and Mitsuba 3 libraries as well as scripting within Blender to execute the task.\n\nTo get more detailed step-by-step instruction or code snippets, you may want to look at the add-ons' official documentation for Blender, the Mitsuba 3 Compatibility Guide, any provided tutorials or examples, or the Sionna user manual for scene creation and rendering.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nCreating scene files for Mitsuba 3 that are compatible with Sionna in Blender requires following specific steps, including setting up the software environment, designing the scene, and exporting the files correctly. While the provided context does not offer detailed instructions for this exact process, it gives information on how the Sionna RT module functions and its interplay with Mitsuba 3 and Blender. With that in mind, here is a guide on creating Mitsuba 3 scene files for Sionna using Blender:\n\n### Step 1: Software Installation and Setup\n1. **Install Blender:** Download and install Blender, the open-source 3D creation suite, from the official website (https://www.blender.org/).\n   \n2. **Install Mitsuba 3 and Dr.Jit:** Mitsuba 3 depends on Dr.Jit, a differentiable just-in-time compiler. Follow the installation guide for your system provided at https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/.\n\n3. **Install the Mitsuba-Blender Add-on:** Get the Mitsuba-Blender add-on from https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba-blender, which allows Blender to interface with Mitsuba 3 rendering features. Follow the provided instructions to install this add-on in Blender.\n   \n4. **Install Blender-OSM Add-on (Optional):** For importing real-world locations into Blender, consider purchasing and installing the Blender-OSM add-on from https://prochitecture.gumroad.com/l/blender-osm.\n\n### Step 2: Scene Creation in Blender\n1. **Create the Scene:** Open Blender and create a 3D scene as per your requirements. If you're using the Blender-OSM add-on, import the geographic data for the location you want to model.\n\n2. **Set Materials and Textures:** Assign materials to your objects that are compatible with Mitsuba 3. You may need to look for Blender-Mitsuba material compatibility or convert Blender materials to Mitsuba-compatible ones through the add-on.\n\n3. **Configure the Blender Scene for Mitsuba 3:** Use the Mitsuba-Blender add-on to ensure that lights, materials, and camera settings are suitable for Mitsuba 3 rendering.\n\n### Step 3: Exporting the Mitsuba Scene File\n1. **Export from Blender:** Once your scene is ready, export it as a Mitsuba 3 scene file (XML format). The Mitsuba-Blender add-on should provide you an export option to save the scene in Mitsuba's file format.\n\n### Step 4: Verify and Load the Scene in Sionna\n1. **Inspect the XML File:** Check the exported XML file to ensure it includes all the necessary scene elements and settings in a format compatible with Mitsuba 3.\n\n2. **Load the Scene in Sionna:**\n   - In Python, you would use the Sionna RT module to load the scene as follows (replace `'path_to_scene_file.xml'` with the path to your exported scene file):\n     ```python\n     from sionna.rt import load_scene\n     scene = load_scene(\"path_to_scene_file.xml\")\n     ```\n\n### Step 5: Visualization and Simulation (Optional)\n1. **Preview the Scene (if using Jupyter):**\n   - Use the `preview` function in Sionna to open an interactive preview of the scene (not available in Colab):\n     ```python\n     if not colab_compat:\n         scene.preview()\n     ```\n\n2. **Render a High-Quality Image:**\n   - To render the scene in high quality, use:\n     ```python\n     if not colab_compat:\n         scene.render(camera=\"your_camera\", num_samples=512)\n     ```\n   - Replace `\"your_camera\"` with the camera identifier you configured in Blender.\n\n3. **Simulate Ray Tracing in Sionna:**\n   - Utilize Sionna's RT components to simulate ray-traced channels based on the loaded scene.\n\nRemember, the entire process of creating scenes and using them for ray tracing simulations relies on harmonious compatibility among Blender, the Mitsuba-Blender add-on, Mitsuba 3, and Sionna RT.

Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior.

Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level.

Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nHow does one determine if the BER performance curves are accurately simulated using the all-zero codeword technique in Sionna?\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nUsing the all-zero codeword technique within the Sionna framework to determine the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of a communication system allows for easier benchmarking and performance evaluations, as this method involves a known, correctable error pattern for the channel conditions at hand. The process involves transmitting a codeword filled with all zeros over the channel and then using the same demapping, decoding, and error counting as performed for a simulated word.\n\nTo verify the accuracy of the simulated BER performance curves obtained using this technique, one must adhere to certain principles. These are the considerations outlined in the provided context:\n\n1. **SNR Difference** \u2013 An important criterion to consider when checking the accuracy of the all-zero message results is that there should be a small signal-to-noise ratio \\( (\\text{SNR}) \\). This is because in these low SNR regions, an all-zero codeword transmitted over an additively Gaussian noise channel should almost never be decoded at a codeword error rate (\\(P_c\\)) of \u201c0.\u201d\n\n2. **Convergence of the Iterative Demapping and Decoding** \u2013 The process must ensure that there\u2019s convergence of the iterative demapping and decoding algorithms for both the all-zero and true messages. Codes that are bootstrapped for certain iterations, during which no signal is passed, can be used for both messages.\n\n3. **Determining Corrected Bits** \u2013 The decoder should effectively correct the all-zero codeword errors and produce an output with all zeros. This is typically checked using the Hard Decision (HD) or Euclidean detection log likelihood ratio (LLR) outputs.\n\n4. **Performance Metrics** \u2013 The BER performance curve is based on the fraction of non-zero codeword estimates that did not meet the given error criterion. In this context, the FER is further refined as a binary sequence of corrected bits (0 or 1) in the binary sequence of the estimated codeword. Being the ratio of non-zero estimated codewords with non-zero BER, FER is assumed to be always \u201c1.\u201d For this accurate simulation technique, you analyze only the first bit of the output codeword.\n\n5. **Consideration of Standard Deviation** \u2013 A standard deviation (STD) in the estimated ERGM of corrected bits should be approximately zero. Non-zero STD values occur due to finite block effects and slight inaccuracies in the reported Error Rates, requiring larger sample numbers for accurate estimates and thus a trade-off between large \\(n\\) and the number of samples.\n\n6. **Reference Curves** \u2013 It is also useful to generate reference curves for certain decoders with precomputed expected constant modulus and EVM curves to ensure that the performance is within a reasonable range.\n\n7. **Parallel Processing** \u2013 As discussed, caution is advised when using parallel processing rather than sequential that could result in memory allocation errors.\n\n8. **Comparing SISO and Nested Processing Effectively** \u2013 For practical applications, it is crucial to compare SISO (Soft In Soft Out) with nested decoders under a practical setup, ensuring that any differences fall within an acceptable range.\n\nIn essence, the accurately modeled BER performance curves reflect an almost perfect error-correction condition when the channel is \u201cdoped\u201d with all-zero codeword messages transmitted over an AWGN channel. By comparing these conditions to the BER performance under non-zero codeword conditions, simulations can be performed to a level of confidence not achievable using, for instance, signal-to-noise ratios alone.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo determine if the BER (Bit Error Rate) performance curves are accurately simulated using the all-zero codeword technique in Sionna, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simulate the Baseline with Encoder:** First, simulate the system's performance with a proper encoder to establish a baseline BER performance curve. This involves using the LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) encoder to encode random bits, mapping the encoded bits to symbols via a mapper, transmitting the symbols through the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel, and finally demapping and decoding at the receiver to estimate the transmitted bits and calculate the BER.\n\n2. **Simulate Using All-Zero Codeword:** Next, remove the LDPC encoder from the simulation and replace it with an all-zero codeword. This means that you transmit a codeword consisting of all zeros, map it to symbols, transmit the symbols through the AWGN channel, demap, and decode at the receiver. Since linear codes, like LDPC codes, tend to have uniform error performance across all codewords on average, the performance of the all-zero codeword should be representative of the performance of any random codeword.\n\n3. **Compare BER Curves:** Compare the BER curve from the all-zero codeword simulation with the baseline BER curve. If the all-zero codeword technique is accurate, the two curves should match within the statistical variations of the Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n4. **Scrambler Analysis (For Higher Order Modulations):** For higher-order modulations, a scrambler may be required before transmission and a descrambler before decoding. This is because higher-order modulation constellations may not be symmetric, and there could be a bias towards certain symbols in the constellation. The scrambler randomizes the pattern of transmission, ensuring that the BER simulation reflects the average performance of the system. Conduct a simulation with the scrambler in place and compare the BER curves to both the baseline and the previous unscrambled all-zero codeword simulation. The BER curves should align well. If not, that suggests an issue with the symmetry requirement or other assumptions in your simulation setup.\n\n5. **Gaussian Approximation (For BPSK/QPSK):** You can also simulate the BER performance using a Gaussian approximation of the LLR distribution for the all-zero codeword. This involves bypassing the actual transmission of symbols through the AWGN channel and directly generating the LLRs (Log-Likelihood Ratios) according to a Gaussian distribution, which should match the distribution of LLRs that you would expect from the mapper, channel, and demapper. Then decode using these LLRs. This technique should also give a BER curve similar to the baseline.\n\n6. **Careful Review of Assumptions:** Ensure that the decoder used in simulations is symmetric in its treatment of LLRs. This means that the decoder should not be biased toward positive or negative LLRs. Any discrepancies in BER curves might hint at asymmetry in the decoder.\n\n7. **Statistical Significance:** Make sure that if there is any mismatch between the baseline and subsequent BER performance curves, you run enough trials to have statistical significance. Variations can occur due to the random nature of Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n8. **Check for Errors and Environmental Factors:** The accuracy of the BER performance curves is subject to the correctness of the simulation setup. Any coding mistakes, misunderstandings of the system model, or environmental factors such as noise in the channel model, as well as the SNR settings, can affect the outcome of the simulations. Be meticulous in your setup and consider these factors during your analysis.\n\nThe steps and techniques above, if carried out properly, should allow you to validate whether the all-zero codeword technique in Sionna provides an accurate representation of the BER performance for your system.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.\n\n2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.\n\n3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.\n\n4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.\n\n**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**\n\n- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

To incorporate information from the context appropriately, we have utilized the given descriptions of the antenna's power pattern, radiative efficiency, and the model's directional gains' peak (`gb_dir`). It's important to ensure that input values such as `input_power_dbm` and `radiated_power_dbm` are obtained from real experimental or simulation measurements to accurately represent the given conditions.\n\nThe result, when formulating your final response, should be a markdown string structured like this:\n\n```\nThe radiated power, considering the antenna's directional gain, is calculated to be E_on_boresight [in dB] dBm.\n```\n\nReplace the placeholder `[in dB]` with the dB value of `E_on_boresight` to provide the precise radiated power while being mindful of the necessary string formatting for a clean and understandable response.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo calculate the radiated power of an antenna with a given input power and radiation efficiency, and incorporating the directional gain using Sionna, you can follow these steps in a Python script:\n\n1.

Calculate the total radiated power by multiplying the input power with the radiation efficiency. \n4. Use Sionna to define the antenna pattern and calculate the directional gain.\n5. Multiply the radiated power with the directional gain to find the power in a specific direction.\n\nHere's a Python script template that shows how these steps can come together:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sionna\n\n# Define the input parameters\ninput_power = 100  # Power in Watts\nradiation_efficiency = 0.9  # Efficiency as a fraction\nfrequency = 3e9  # Frequency in Hz (for example, 3 GHz)\n\n# Calculate the total radiated power\nradiated_power = input_power * radiation_efficiency\n\n# Use Sionna to define your antenna (e.g., isotropic antenna)\n# (Replace with your antenna specifications and calculations)\nantenna_gain = some_sionna_function_to_define_and_calculate_gain(frequency)\n\n# Calculate the power radiated in the direction of maximum gain\npower_with_gain = radiated_power * antenna_gain\n\nprint(f\"The radiated power in the direction of maximum gain is {power_with_gain} Watts.\")\n```\n\nReplace `some_sionna_function_to_define_and_calculate_gain` with the specific Sionna function or sequence of functions to define and calculate the gain of your antenna. You might need to define an antenna object, set up the pattern or use a predefined model if available in Sionna, and then perform gain calculations accordingly.\n\nPlease adjust the values of input parameters (`input_power`, `radiation_efficiency`, and `frequency`) and the methods from Sionna to suit your specific case.\n\nIt is important to consult Sionna's documentation for the precise methods for defining antenna models and calculating gain.

Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.\nSample 1:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness\uff1a Partially Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The answer is adjudged as good within the 'Partially Correct' range due to its relatively well-executed code, earning it 6 points.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nTo encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\nSetting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n```\n\nThis line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nSince the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

The <SionnaAssistant>'s answer addresses only a limited portion of the content and lacks specificity, so it does not warrant a score of 3 but rather 2 points.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome crucial hints to score correctness: \n1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.\n8.

An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized as 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.\n\n- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system(\"pip install sionna\") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness.

Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations. In contrast, the <SionnaAssistant> answer scarcely aligns with this flow, placing it within the limited correctness level.\n\nRegarding key classes, methods, and parameters, only y=channel() is present in the <SionnaAssistant> answer, which is minimal compared to the expected code complexity.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5. In the illustration, consider formulas as key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.\n6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it as \"Limited\" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.\n7.

Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.\n\n    \n    \nPlease provide your evaluation in the following format:\nInstruction:\n<INSTRUCTION>\nEnsure proper understanding of using the BinarySource, LDPC5GEncoder, Mapper, and Demapper classes and methods provided by the Sionna package for signal generation and processing.\n\n</INSTRUCTION>\nSionna Assistant Model's Answer:\n<SionnaAssistant>\nBased on the provided context, when using the **Sionna** package for signal generation and processing, you can use the following classes and methods:\n\n1. **BinarySource**\n    - This class generates a stream of binary digits which can be then used for communication purposes. The binary source is typically used to generate the digital message in binary form that will be encoded and ultimately transmitted over a channel. To instantiate a BinarySource, you can provide the number of samples you wish the source to generate, and if needed, a seed for deterministic output.\n\n    Instantiate a BinarySource:\n    ```python\n    b_source = BinarySource(num_bits=1000000, seed=None)\n    ```\n\n2. **LDPC5GEncoder**\n    - This class represents a 5G LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) encoder block. An LDPC code is an error-correcting code that operates on binary sequences. The encoder takes a binary input and produces a binary output that contains redundancy to detect and/or correct errors.\n\n    To use LDPC5GEncoder, instantiate it along with an appropriate size and rate.\n\n    Instantiate an LDPC5GEncoder:\n    ```python\n    num_c = 1000  # Codeword length\n    rate = 1/3  # Code rate\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(num_c=num_c, rate=rate)\n    ```\n\n3. **Mapper**\n    - This class is used for symbol mapping, which is the process of transforming binary input data into a modulated form suitable for transmission over a communication channel. Constellation shaping is a critical aspect here, as the symbols are drawn from a specific constellation (e.g., QAM, PAM) based on the channel conditions and available SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).\n\n    Instantiate a Mapper:\n    ```python\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_c)\n    ```\n\n4. **Demapper**\n    - This class performs the inverse operation of the Mapper. After transmission through a channel, the demapper is used to recover the symbol estimates from the noisy received signal. These are then converted back to bit estimates, closing the digital modulation-demodulation chain.\n\n    Instantiate a Demapper:\n    ```python\n    demapper = Demapper(mapper=mapper, app=\"soft\")\n    ```\n\nIn a complete signal processing chain with these classes, you would generate random bits using BinarySource, encode them using LDPC5GEncoder, map the bits to symbols using Mapper, transmit these symbols through a channel, receive the noisy symbols, and then demap and perform LDPC decoding to estimate the transmitted bits.\n\nNotice that significant extra code is given in the provided context, including the simulation of a complete end-to-end transmission, which involves SISO (Soft-Input Soft-Output) demapping, an SDR (Soft-Decision-Run) LDPC decoder, and the necessary utility functions. The system's performance is analyzed to understand how noise and channel impairments affect signal error rates. This overall workflow is mainstream in the signal processing of digital communications, especially in simulated environments. Users can follow it to become familiar with all aspects of digital communication signal processing and evaluate system performance under different conditions.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo properly understand and use the classes BinarySource, LDPC5GEncoder, Mapper, and Demapper from the Sionna package for signal generation and processing, let's discuss each component separately.\n\n1. **BinarySource:** This class is used to generate random binary data which can be used as input information bits for communications simulations. The `BinarySource` creates a tensor of random bits of the specified shape.\n\n   To use the `BinarySource`, you would typically initialize it and then call it to generate binary data, as in the following example:\n\n   ```python\n   binary_source = BinarySource()\n   b = binary_source([batch_size, 1, num_streams, k])\n   ```\n\n   In the context provided, `batch_size`, `num_streams`, and `k` would dictate the shape of the tensor of random binary bits generated (i.e., the number of sets of bits, the number of streams per set, and the number of bits per stream, respectively).\n\n2. **LDPC5GEncoder:** This class encodes binary data using a 5G Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code. The LDPC encoder takes a block of information bits and produces a block of coded bits (which includes both information bits and parity bits).\n\n   Usage typically involves creating an instance of the encoder with the desired code length parameters and then passing binary data to it:\n\n   ```python\n   encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n   c = encoder(b)\n   ```\n\n   Here, `k` is the number of information bits and `n` is the total number of bits in the encoded block (which must be compatible with the defined 5G LDPC base graph configurations).\n\n3. **Mapper:** This class maps binary data to complex symbol constellations, typically used in modulation schemes such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).\n\n   The instantiation of a `Mapper` includes defining the modulation scheme and the number of bits per symbol. Once initialized, it takes encoded binary data and maps it to the symbol constellation defined:\n\n   ```python\n   mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n   x = mapper(c)\n   ```\n\n   The `num_bits_per_symbol` parameter is influenced by the chosen modulation scheme, where, for example, 4-QAM (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) would use 2 bits per symbol, and 16-QAM would use 4 bits per symbol.\n\n4. **Demapper:** Conversely to the Mapper, the `Demapper` takes complex-modulated symbols and computes Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) or hard bit decisions for the received data. This is typically part of the demodulation process in a receiver.\n\n   The `Demapper` requires the demapping type, modulation scheme, and the number of bits per symbol. Its usage would be as follows, taking into consideration the noise variance that affects the received signal:\n\n   ```python\n   demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n   llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n   ```\n\n   The `x_hat` represents the received symbols after going through the channel and equalization, and `no_eff` can represent the effective noise variance after equalization.\n\nTo create a signal processing chain using these classes, you would generally follow the steps of generating data (`BinarySource`), encoding it (`LDPC5GEncoder`), mapping the encoded bits to symbols (`Mapper`), performing channel modulation and demodulation, and finally demapping the symbols to bits (`Demapper`). In a communication system simulation such as the one in the provided context, this would form the core part of the transmitter and receiver signal processing.\n\nRegarding the Sionna package usage, remember that tensor shapes are critical to each operation. All tensors processing in Sionna typically follow the convention `[batch_size, time_dimension, num_tx or num_rx, num_features]`, so ensure to match this format when passing data between components. The accurate understanding and application of this format will ensure proper simulation and results reproduction when involved in MIMO OFDM simulations, as outlined in the context provided.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

Different implementation methods are permissible as long as they yield the same result.

Any deviation from this principle, as seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.\n\n**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**\n\n\nBelow are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These two samples are two tables.

First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6\u2014the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nSample2:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correct</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: The code and illustration in the Sionna Assistant Model exhibit minimal relevance to those in the reference, warranting the lowest score within the limited correctness category: 1 point. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.\n\nIn order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

The Sionna library, which is a deep learning framework with a strong focus on simulation tools for telecommunication, describes this process as being divided into several stages. Here is a concise breakdown of each stage:\n\n1. **Segmentation**:\n   - This stage transforms a vector of input bits into a matrix. The row size `K` will equal the segment size, while the number of rows `V` will be the number of segmentation vectors. This is necessary to work with the data in smaller blocks, easing operations on large amounts of information.\n\n2. **CRC Addition**:\n   - After segmentation, a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code is added to the end of each data segment, for error detection purposes. The padding is done using systematic CRC coding.\n\n3. **FEC Encoding (LDPC Encoding)**:\n   - The Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoder in the Sionna library is used for this stage. LDPC codes are linear block codes defined by a sparse parity-check matrix which is typically used in 5G to encode the transport blocks.\n\n4. **Interleaving**:\n   - This stage performs a pseudo-random reordering of bits in the data. Interleaving is important to spread out burst errors over a wider area, making it easier for the error correction algorithms to fix them.\n\n5. **Scrambling**:\n   - A scrambler, through bitwise-xor operations, introduces controlled randomness into the bit sequence. This serves to whiten the signal spectrum, ensuring that the overall dynamic range of the signal remains relatively constant and making the signal resistant to certain types of channel impairments.\n\n6. **Codeword Concatenation**:\n   - Finally, after each precoding layer, streams are spatially multiplexed using closed-loop precoding with codebook subset restriction. These spatial layers are then combined, and codewords are created by cyclically shifting the layers.\n\nAll these stages Ready the data for modulation and transmission over the wireless channel.\n\nThe Sionna library allows flexibly defining and configuring the specifics for each of these stages, enabling the simulation of various 5G encoding scenarios based on standard specifications or for custom research and development.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nThe TB (Transport Block) encoding process in 5G NR (New Radio) is a sequence of steps that prepare a block of information bits for transmission over the air interface. This process ensures that the data can be transmitted efficiently and is resilient against errors introduced by the communication channel. Here's an overview of the various stages involved in TB encoding:\n\n1. **Segmentation**: The input information bit sequence\u2014the transport block\u2014may be too large to be processed as a single entity. Therefore, it is divided into smaller sized segments known as code blocks. This division helps to manage the encoding process more efficiently and facilitate the use of forward error correction (FEC) techniques. \n\n2. **CRC Addition**: After segmentation, a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is added to each code block. The CRC is a sequence of redundant bits that serves as a checksum for error detection. This allows the receiver to detect if a code block has been corrupted during transmission. The CRC is added to the entire TB if the TB is not segmented or if it is added to individual code blocks when segmentation occurs.\n\n3. **FEC Encoding**: The next step is channel coding using FEC. The standard FEC scheme used in NR is Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) encoding. LDPC adds parity bits to the code blocks, which increase redundancy and allow the receiver to detect and correct errors within limits.\n\n4. **Interleaving**: Once the code blocks have been FEC encoded, an interleaving process permutes the coded bits. Interleaving is performed to distribute errors more evenly across the transmitted data. This step mitigates the impact of burst errors that tend to corrupt bits grouped closely together by scattering them over a wider range, thus improving the effectiveness of error correction at the receiver.\n\n5. **Scrambling**: The interleaved bits are then scrambled using a pseudo-random sequence. Scrambling ensures that the transmitted signal has good correlation properties and helps in mitigating interference. It also helps to distinguish between transmissions from different users or layers by using user-specific or layer-specific scrambling sequences.\n\n6. **Codeword Concatenation**: If the original TB was divided into multiple code blocks or if multiple TBs are transmitted simultaneously, the scrambled code blocks or multiple codewords need to be concatenated together to form the final sequence for transmission over the physical channel.\n\nThese stages constitute the TB encoding scheme as defined in the 3GPP Technical Specifications, specifically TS 38.214 and TS 38.211, which the given context references. Notably, the context provided mentions a code snippet from a Python library (`sionna.nr.TBEncoder`) that seemingly implements a TB encoder according to these standards and applicable to the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The `TBEncoder` class of this library presumably encapsulates the aforementioned encoding stages, allowing users to encode a transport block by instantiating the class with the appropriate parameters (like target transport block size, coderate, and others) and then calling it with the input information bits.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.

The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow\nimport sionna, tensorflow, numpy\n\n# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder\n# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.\nencoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)\ndecoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type=\"scl\")\n\n# Generate the input tensor for the encoder\nbatch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size\nk = encoder.k # Number of information bits\ninput_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n\n# Encode the information bits and generate codewords\ncw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)\n\n# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords\n# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)\nllr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)\n\n# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages\n# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding\nllr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP\nmessage_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)\n```\n\nThis code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.\n\nNote that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.\n\nKeep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem\u2019s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.\n\nFirst, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:\n\n```python\n# Import required classes from Sionna library\nfrom sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder\n```\n\nNow, set up the encoder and decoder:\n\n```python\n# Number of information bits (input)\nk = 100\n# Number of codeword bits (output)\nn = 200\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)\n\n# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type=\"SCL\", list_size=8)\n```\n\nUsing the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode\n# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)\n# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode\n\n# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode\nbatch_size = 10\nu = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)\n\n# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`\nc = encoder(u)\n\n# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience\n# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling\n# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a\n# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.\n# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise\n\n# Generate some Gaussian noise\nnoise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))\n\n# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords\nllr = c + noise\n\n# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`\nu_hat = decoder(llr)\n```\n\nThe `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nIn the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:\n\nFirstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.\n\nSecondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.\n\nThe textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.\n\nAll in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category.

First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.\n\n### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna\nFor our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.\n\nFirst, setting up the environment:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid\nfrom sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping\nfrom sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4\nfrom sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper\nfrom sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder\nfrom sionna.utils import EbN0C2No\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsubcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz\nnum_ofdm_symbols = 14\nnum_resource_blocks = 100\n\n# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation\nrg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, \n                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,\n                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,\n                      compute_like_nr=False)\n```\n\nNow, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:\n\n```python\nmcs = {\n    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n\npdsch = {\n    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])\n    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2\n}\n```\n\nWe can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:\n\n```python\nf\"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps\"\n```\n\n### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput\nTo visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)\nblock_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])\n\nenc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()\ndec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()\n\nthroughput = {}\n\nfor k in [1, 2]:\n    alias_k = f\"ti_{k}\"\n    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)\n    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)\n    \n    # Model the PDSCH transmission\n    @tf.function\n    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):\n        channel = Channel(kind=\"umi_los\", \n                          num_tx=4, \n                          num_rx=4,\n                          return_compiled_function=True)\n        \n        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)\n        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding\n        return llr, no\n\n    throughputs = []\n    for block_length in block_lengths:\n        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, \"5gmc\", \"qam\"])\n        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])\n        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:\n            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)\n            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)\n            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)\n            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)\n            throughputs.append(throughput)\n    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)\n\n# Now we can plot the results.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n```\n\nNext, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\n\n```python\n## Continuation from the last code segment ##\n\n# Next, we pick specific block lengths\u2014configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.\nfor k in throughput:\n    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel(\"$\\mathsf{E}_b/\\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Throughput [Mbit/s]\")\nplt.title(\"Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5\")\nplt.grid(True, which=\"both\", linewidth=0.5)\n```\n\nThis code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.\n\nIn the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs\n\n# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index\nmcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214\n\n# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH\nfor table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard\n    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, \n                                               table_index=table_index, \n                                               channel_type='PDSCH')\n    print(f\"Table Index: {table_index}\")\n    print(f\"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}\")\n    print(f\"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------\")\n```\n\nIn the code above:\n\n- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.\n- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.\n- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.\n- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.\n\nBy running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: The reference answer is composed of equal parts code and illustration. Therefore, both the code and the illustration must be examined. We first focus on the code:\n\nInitially, we consider the code's format. In the import section, the Sionna Assistant Model imports too much irrelevant code and does not even include some similar ones as in the reference code, such as from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs. Although many codes are written in the Sionna Assistant Model, their format is too cluttered. Additionally, the key class select_mcs does not appear in any for loops.\n\nThe second part of the code check concerns whether the Sionna Assistant Model correctly uses the key Sionna class and its parameters. In this case, the key class is select_mcs. However, the select_mcs method does not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model's code, let alone the usage of parameters of select_mcs. This is a significant failure.\n\nFor the illustration analysis, the reference code's text is primarily explanations of the code. These explanations' key words, such as select_mcs, mcs_index, channel_type, and modulation_order, do not appear in the Sionna Assistant Model, nor do any words with similar meanings. Although the keyword \"table index\" appears correctly, this accurate information is too weak compared to the numerous inaccuracies in the argumentation and discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, both the code and the text in the Sionna Assistant Model are largely incorrect, and the code is very redundant. Therefore, it is categorized as 'Limited Correct'. Since both the text and code are mostly incorrect, it is given the lowest score of 1 within the 'Limited Correct' category.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nSample 3:\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Correctness: Limited Correctness</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Score: 2 points, within the 'Partially Correct' level (1-3 points).</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: \nInitialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:\n\n1. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` is not `int`:\n   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.\n\n2. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:\n   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.\n\n3. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `axis` > number of input dimensions:\n   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.\n\n4. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `inverse` is not `bool`:\n   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n5. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_state` is not `bool`:\n   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.\n\n6. **AssertionError** \u2013 If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:\n   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.\n\nMoreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.\n\nIn summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:\n\n- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.\n- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.\n- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. \n\nThe design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nWhen initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:\n\n- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats as a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known as \\([\\pi]_0\\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.\n- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.\n\nHere are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:\n\n- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: \n  ```\n  \"num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer.\"\n  ```\n  \n- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: \n  ```\n  \"seed must either be a positive int or a\n  \"''\" or have at least one dimension\"\n  ```\n\n  The string \"''\" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.\n\nIt is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.\n\nFor context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.\n\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points.

Below are the detailed steps for conducting these simulations based on the context provided:\n\n1. **GPU Configuration and Imports**:\n    - Configure your GPU settings or set up to use a CPU if preferred.\n    - Import Sionna and other required libraries.\n    - Make sure TensorFlow does not consume more GPU memory than needed.\n\n    ```python\n    import os\n    gpu_num = 0 # Use \"\" to use the CPU\n    os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n    \n    # Import Sionna\n    try:\n        import sionna\n    except ImportError as e:\n        # Install Sionna if package is not already installed\n        import os\n        os.system(\"pip install sionna\")\n        import sionna\n\n    # ... other imports and TensorFlow GPU configuration\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up MIMO Components**:\n    - Define a binary source using `BinarySource()`.\n    - Use `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` for channel coding and decoding.\n    - Define the mapping from bits to symbols with a `Mapper`.\n    - Create the demapper using `Demapper`.\n    - Prepare and reshape the input symbols.\n\n    ```python\n    binary_source = BinarySource()\n    encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)\n    decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True)\n    mapper = Mapper(\"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    demapper = Demapper(\"app\", \"qam\", num_bits_per_symbol)\n    \n    # ... code for generating random QAM symbols and reshaping\n    ```\n    \n3. **Channel Configuration and Transmission**:\n    - Set up a flat-fading channel using `FlatFadingChannel` class.\n    - Transmit the symbols over the configured channel.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume 'x' is your symbol tensor, and 'no' is the noise level\n    y, h = channel([x, no])\n    ```\n\n4. **Apply LMMSE Detection**:\n    - With perfect knowledge of the channel 'h' and noise level 'no', apply the `lmmse_equalizer` function.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat, no_eff = lmmse_equalizer(y, h, s) # where `s` is the covariance matrix\n    ```\n\n5. **Demapping and Decoding**:\n    - Reshape `x_hat` and `no_eff` for the decoder.\n    - Demap the equalized symbols to Log Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n    - Decode the LLRs to recover the transmitted bits.\n\n    ```python\n    x_hat = tf.reshape(x_hat, shape)\n    no_eff = tf.reshape(no_eff, shape)\n    llr = demapper([x_hat, no_eff])\n    b_hat = decoder(llr)\n    ```\n\n6. **Calculate and Print BER/SER**:\n    - Using the original and decoded bits/symbols, compute BER and SER.\n\n    ```python\n    ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy()\n    print(\"Coded BER : {}\".format(ber))\n    ```\n\n7. **Running Simulations Using a Keras Model**:\n    - Wrap the entire simulation process in a Keras model for easy execution.\n    - Use `PlotBER` class for running Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the BER/SER curves across different Eb/No values.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume a Model class is defined as per the context\n    model = Model()\n    \n    ber_plot = PlotBER()\n    ebno_dbs = np.arange(-2.5, 0.25, 0.25) # Example Eb/No range\n    ber_plot.simulate(model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=4096, max_mc_iter=1000, num_target_block_errors=100)\n    ```\n\nThe above steps describe a generic process for BER/SER simulation in Sionna for MIMO systems. The provided context appears to be a tutorial walkthrough to perform such simulations, and it has all the necessary details and code snippets to guide you through the process. Make sure to adjust parameters like the number of antennas, Eb/No values, batch size, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations as per your specific simulation goals or requirements.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo run Bit Error Rate (BER) and Symbol Error Rate (SER) simulations in Sionna for MIMO systems, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n### Set up the MIMO System Configuration\n1. Choose the MIMO configurations including channel, precoder, equalizer, detector, and any other elements required for the simulation.\n2. Define or obtain a dataset that will be used for training and possibly generating validation data, depending on the context of your simulation.\n\n### Transmit Data through the MIMO System\n3. Generate batches of training data using the previously defined dataset. A function such as `gen_batch` from the context is used for that.\n   ```python\n   x, u = gen_batch(batch_size)\n   ```\n\n4. Depending on the task at hand you will either train the system by providing inputs `x` and the true outputs `u` to the Sionna layer that you've defined or simulate channel transmissions for both training and validation.\n   ```python\n   # 3D array with layer-invariant shape\n   xlens  = np.ones(batch_size, dtype=int)*xlen\n   self.layer.set_input(x, xlens, 1.)\n   ```\n   In the case of a simulation, a differentiable problem for training the equalizer might be defined.\n\n5. If you are conducting simulations of transmitting data through the MIMO system, you would encode the information bits, if necessary, using an appropriate digital modulator such as `QAMModulator`, and send the modulated signals through the channel with the defined MIMO precoding.\n   ```python\n   s = mod_psk(u)\n   x = prec_mimo(s)\n   ```\n\n6. Apply noise to the channel outputs to simulate the real-world environment.\n   ```python\n   y = channel([x, no])\n   ```\n\n7. If an equalizer is involved, apply the equalization process to the noisy signals.\n   ```python\n   u_hat = eq([y, no])\n   ```\n\n8. Decode the signals using the selected detector in the simulation. This may involve joint detection and equalization, if appropriate.\n   ```python\n   l = prec_mimo(u_hat)\n   l = detect([y, no])\n   ```\n\n### Evaluate the Transmission Performance\n9. After simulating the MIMO communication system, you would evaluate the performance of the various components by calculating the SER and BER.\n\n10. SER could be computed by measuring the average Euclidean distance between the transmitted and received signals on a per-symbol or per-bit basis, such as with the sample code snippet:\n    ```python\n    ser = euclidean_distance_serk([s, rs, rs_hat])\n    ```\n\n11. BER could be evaluated by comparing the transmitted and received symbols, erroring out any difference. An abstract example in Python could be as follows:\n    ```python\n    err = np.sum(np.not_equal(s_hat.numpy(), u_hat.numpy()), axis=-1)\n    b_valid = np.where(np.less_equal(err, ber_bound), 1., 0.)\n    ber = np.sum(b_valid).astype(np.float32) /  (b_valid.shape[0] * b_valid.shape[2])\n    ```\n\n### End of Simulation\n12. After completion of your simulations, make sure to draw meaningful conclusions based on the observed SER and BER performances. \n   \nPlease note that these steps are described in a generic sense based on the provided context. The actual simulation code will be more intricate and will depend on the specific elements of the Sionna package that you intend to use and the details of your MIMO system configuration.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \n\nThe answer involves both code and illustration, with a primary emphasis on the code since it holds greater importance and the illustration serves to clarify the code.\n\nAnalyzing the reference code, we observe a sequence of operations: importing necessary packages, setting up encoders and decoders with LDPC5GEncoder and LDPC5GDecoder, configuring the channel, applying LMMSE Detection, demapping and decoding, among other simulations.

The implementation will involve setting up layers correctly, defining inputs and outputs with the corresponding data types and shapes, and specifying how wireless channel state information (CSI) is utilized during the model's operation.\n\nThe following steps outline how the `OFDMSystem` class could be implemented:\n1. **Model Configuration**: \n    - Start by defining the number of resource blocks (`num_rb`), the number of symbols (`num_symbol`), and other necessary parameters.\n    - Decide whether the implementation will use perfect CSI or LS channel estimation. This decision will alter the structure of the model and the way data is passed through it.\n2. **Layer Definition**: Use Keras layers to create the structure of the OFDM system.\n    - For perfect CSI, implement the PerfectCellEstimator layer, which computes the CSI from predefined channels for each user. This layer has an associated channel layer that would generate the channel matrix `h` layer by using the true CSI (Kronecker delta mapping).\n    - If LS estimation is to be used, implement the LS channel estimator. This would estimate the channel `h_est` from the received OFDM resource grid `y` that includes the transmitted pilots.\n    - After channel estimation, an InterpolatePilots layer would be used to inpaint pilot symbols across the resource grid.\n    - Follow with a known-data pilot-based equalization using the `OFDMEqualizer` layer that would use the `lmmse` equalizer and interpolating the received data carrier symbols.\n3. **Input and Output Definition**: \n    - Input data for the model consists of noisy OFDM resource grids `y` and the equalizer's noise variance `no`.\n    - The direct output from the model would be the estimated frame bits `x_est`.\n    - If an explicit model for `y_est`, the estimated OFDM resource grid is to be output, this would require a custom Lambda layer that would perform the following transformation, assuming `x_est` contains log-likelihood ratios (LLRs):\n        \\[\n        \\operatorname{LLRProcessor()}{\text{(x= }x\text{, x_est= }}x_\text{est}\text{+no\\_equalizer\text{, axis=3))}{=}\text{y_est}\n        \\]\n\nAs can be observed from the context, there are already LS and Perfect CSI examples provided in the Sionna simulator environments, under the respective tutorials of [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_csi_ls.html) and [Sion-Ofdm-Channel-Estimation-Pefect-Csi](https://kldtz.github.io/sion-tutorials/html/sion_ofdm_channel_estimation_perfect_csi.html). You will be able to harness the `OFDMSystem` class there and also ascertain the conditions for using either LS channel estimation or perfect CSI to closely align your specific scenario with domain-driven practices.\n\nIt is important to follow an iterative process when implementing such a model to ensure its correctness and performance. Moreover, accessing pre-existing code, samples, and documentation will aid in understanding the structure and conventions that are considered best practices within the Sionna framework.\n      \n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference Answer: \nTo implement the `OFDMSystem` class as a Keras model in TensorFlow, you will need to utilize the structure provided in the provided context and tailor it to have the flexibility of using either least squares (LS) estimation or perfect channel state information (CSI) based on a condition.\n\nHere is a high-level description of the steps to implement this:\n\n1. **Inherit from the Keras Model Class:**\n   You will define your `OFDMSystem` class to inherit from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` class, providing it with model training and inference functionalities.\n   \n2. **Initializing the Class:**\n   The class initializer (constructor) should accept a boolean flag such as `perfect_csi` that determines which channel estimation technique to use. If `perfect_csi` is `True`, the model should bypass the LS estimation and use the perfect CSI directly.\n\n3. **Defining Layers:**\n   Create instance variables for each layer of the OFDM system within the `__init__` method. This will include layers for binary source generation, encoding, mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, LS channel estimation, equalization, demapping, and decoding.\n\n4. **Implementing the `call` Method:**\n   The `call` method is where the data flow of the model is defined. It takes the `batch_size` and `ebno_db` as arguments. Convert the `ebno_db` to the noise variance using utility functions provided by Sionna (e.g., `ebnodb2no`). Then, sequentially pass the generated information bits through each layer as specified in the context: bits are generated, encoded, mapped, resource grid-mapped, passed through the channel, and equalized.\n\n5. **Handling LS Estimation vs. Perfect CSI:**\n   Within the `call` method and after the channel simulation, use the `perfect_csi` flag to decide whether to use the LS estimation or the perfect CSI.\n\nHere's how you can construct the model class based on the context:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import Model\n\nclass OFDMSystem(Model):\n    def __init__(self, perfect_csi):\n        super().__init__()  # Call the Keras model initializer\n        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi\n        # Initialize necessary layers...\n        # ... (rest of the initializer)\n\n    @tf.function  # Use TensorFlow graph execution for efficiency\n    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):\n        # Convert Eb/N0 to noise power spectral density (N0)\n        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,\n                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)\n        # Transmitter operations...\n        # Channel simulation...\n        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])\n        # Receiver operations\n        if self.perfect_csi:\n            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.\n        else:\n            # Perform least squares (LS) estimation\n            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])\n        # Further processing (equalization, demapping, decoding)...\n        return bits, bits_hat\n```\n\nReplace the \"...\" with the appropriate layers mentioned in the context and follow the process outlined in the context's example. Make sure to define parameters like `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `RESOURCE_GRID`, etc., outside of the class definition or pass them as arguments if necessary.\n\nWhen using this class, you would create two instances: one where `perfect_csi` is `True` for perfect CSI, and another where `perfect_csi` is `False` for LS estimation. You can then simulate and compare their performances by passing different Eb/N0 values.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate the OFDM systems with LS estimation and perfect CSI\nmodel_ls = OFDMSystem(False)\nmodel_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)\n\n# Simulate the performance for both setups\n# ...\n```\n\nThe simulation and performance analysis can take place using methods such as `simulate` from Sionna's utility functions, or by calling the Keras model's training functions if further training is required.\n\n</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Explanation: \nWe can observe that the reference answer contains a significant amount of code, which is neither present nor explained in the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer.

When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range\u20144 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category\u20146 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies\u2014adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.\n2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such as package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code as presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.\n3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, as there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**\n4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the \"degree\" of correctness in your scoring.\n5.

However, in a MIMO or multi-antenna system, the spatial correlation between the antenna elements carried on both sides of the communication link can be significant. To add spatial correlation to the flat-fading channel model within Sionna, the following action plan can be followed:\n\n**Action Plan for Adding Spatial Correlation to Sionna's Flat-Fading Channel Model**\n\n1. **Understand the Concept**: Spatial correlation in a wireless system describes how the signals from different antenna elements are related to each other in space. It can be used to simulate how signals propagate in directions that do not fall into the line-of-sight.\n\n2. **Explore Existing Sionna Implementations**: Start by looking at Sionna\u2019s documentation and source code to understand how Sionna handles MIMO channel modeling and what components are available that could be modified to include spatial correlation.\n\n3. **Identify Antenna Array Structure**: Before adding spatial correlation, you need to verify the existing antenna array structure and the data structures for holding the channel information. In Sionna, the function `FlatFading` might have to be extended to include parameters for specifying a custom spatial correlation structure, if it currently doesn't have it.\n\n4. **Update Channel Models**: Once you understand the base structure, the modifications required will be primarily in the generation of the channel coefficients. Typically, this means refining the **RayleighBlockFading** model, which simulates horizontal (temporal) correlation and modifying it to incorporate the appropriate spatial correlation.\n\n5. **Generate Spatial Correlation Matrices**: In line with the specifics of the MIMO Array and importantly the propagation model (4GCoronagraph, 3GPP38901...), which may contain options for modeling spatial correlation, you'll need to generate spatial correlation matrices. If direct functionality for this isn't available in the existing classes provided by Sionna, you may need to write a new utility that can generate these matrices.\n\n6. **Integrate Changes in the Flat-Fading Model Call**: The changes involving spatial correlation matrices then need to be seamlessly integrated into the `FlatFading` model. Ensure that spatial correlation can be included as a parameter or that the channel model can infer it from other parameters you provide, such as angle-of-departure and angle-of-arrival.\n\n7. **Updated Configuration**: There might be a number of configuration parameters that also need to be checked in relation to spatial correlation. Ensure that when you set up the simulation parameters for a MIMO system within Sionna, the spatial correlation options (if any) are set correctly.\n\n8. **Testing and Validation**: After making the required implementation changes, test the revised `FlatFading` model by simulating scenarios where explicit spatial correlation matters (e.g., high scattering, large antenna arrays where spatial correlation might be non-negligible). Compare the output obtained with the expected output to verify the spatial correlation has been accurately included in your model.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAdding spatial correlation to an already existing model like Sionna's flat-fading channel involves understanding the data structures used in the software, modifying how the channel coefficients are generated, creating a mechanism to include the generated spatial correlation matrices, and updating the configuration options.\n\nNote that this action plan is a guide to help you understand the logic of including spatial correlation in a flat-fading channel model within Sionna. Adequate knowledge of the Sionna library, and electromagnetic wave propagation, wireless communication, MIMO systems, ray tracing tools, and array signal processing would be necessary for its successful implementation.\n</SionnaAssistant>\nReference Answer:\n<Reference>\nTo add spatial correlation to the flat-fading channel model in Sionna's Python package, follow this action plan:\n\n1. **Preliminary Understanding:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with the current flat-fading channel model implementation in the Sionna package.\n   - Understand the mathematical model of spatial correlation in MIMO channels and how it should integrate with the existing flat-fading model.\n\n2. **Design Phase:**\n   - Define the spatial correlation properties you wish to model (e.g., the Kronecker, Weichselberger, or virtual channel representation model).\n   - Determine the necessary parameters for the spatial correlation model (e.g., correlation matrices for transmit and receive antennas, angles of departure and arrival, etc.).\n   - Identify how these parameters will be input or generated in the Sionna framework. Consider whether they will be user-input, derived from other channel parameters, or generated using a stochastic model.\n\n3. **Development Phase:**\n   - Create a subclass or modify the existing flat-fading class to include the spatial correlation functionality. Respect the architectural patterns used in the Sionna package.\n   - Implement functions to calculate the correlation matrix for both the transmitter and receiver side.\n   - Integrate the correlation matrix into the channel coefficient generation process for the flat-fading channel model, ensuring that the spatial correlation effect is applied.\n\n4. **Testing Phase:**\n   - Develop a comprehensive set of tests that check the spatial correlation features against known results or theory.\n   - Special attention should be paid to the validation of the generated channel matrices which should exhibit the desired correlation properties.\n   - Run tests for a variety of scenarios with different parameter sets to ensure robustness.\n\n5. **Documentation and Examples:**\n   - Clearly document the new spatial correlation features in the channel model. Explain the mathematical model and parameters used.\n   - Provide clear usage examples to guide users on how to incorporate spatial correlation into their simulations.\n   - Update existing documentation to reflect the new feature.\n\n6. **Review and Integration:**\n   - Perform a code review to ensure that coding standards are maintained, and the implementation aligns with the design goals.\n   - Integrate the new feature into the Sionna package with appropriate version control measures.\n\n7. **Release and Feedback:**\n   - Release the updated package with spatial correlation features.\n   - Collect feedback from the user community and be prepared to make iterative improvements based on the feedback received.\n\nThroughout this process, it is important to follow best practices for software development, including writing clean, modular, and well-commented code, adhering to the stylistic norms of the existing Sionna codebase, and ensuring the new features align with the project's overall design philosophy.\n\nKeep in mind this action plan assumes familiarity with Sionna's package structure, Python programming, channel modeling in wireless communication, and the particular implementation details of how channels are simulated in Sionna. It would be important to conduct a review of the current codebase and possibly consult with the Sionna development team or user community throughout this process.\n---\n</Reference>\n\nYour response should include:\n- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line.
