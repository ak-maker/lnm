## GPT 4 prompt
I have fine-tuned a Sionna expert model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. 
Your task is to evaluate the Sionna expert's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided as integers. 
The evaluation should be conducted across four dimensions:

1) Coherence: Assess the coherence between the <SionnaExpert></SionnaExpert> answer and the <Reference></Reference> answer. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates a lack of coherence and 5 indicates perfect coherence.

2) Relevance: Evaluate how well the <SionnaExpert></SionnaExpert> answer addresses the main aspects of the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, with 5 signifying perfect relevance.

3) Groundedness: Determine whether the <SionnaExpert></SionnaExpert> answer follows logically from the <INSTRUCTION></INSTRUCTION>. Scored out of 5, where 1 indicates that the answer is not grounded in the context, and 5 indicates that the answer is fully grounded.

4) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaExpert></SionnaExpert> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.

Please provide your evaluation in the following format:
Instruction:
<INSTRUCTION>
{instruction}
</INSTRUCTION>
Sionna Expert's Answer:
<SionnaExpert>
{finetune_answer}
</SionnaExpert>
Reference Answer:
<Reference>
{reference_answer}
</Reference>

Your response should include:
- The total score as the sum of all individual scores on the first line. The format is like: Total Score: . Remember to seperate response line 1 and line 2 with \n.
- The individual scores for each dimension on the second line, clearly indicated as integers. The format is like: Coherence: , Relevance: , Groundedness: , Correctness: . Remember to seperate response line 2 and line 3 with \n\n.
- A brief explanation for the assigned scores on the third line.
