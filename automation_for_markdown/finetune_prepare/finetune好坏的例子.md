#### **Instruction**:  Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.

#### **Finetune answer**:  

To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:

```python
# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow
import sionna, tensorflow, numpy

# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder
# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.
encoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)
decoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type="scl")

# Generate the input tensor for the encoder
batch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size
k = encoder.k # Number of information bits
input_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)

# Encode the information bits and generate codewords
cw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)

# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords
# (Here we use random LLR as we don't have a real channel to simulate)
llr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)

# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages
# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding
llr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP
message_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)
```

This code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.

Note that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.

Keep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes as per your exact requirements, as you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem’s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.

#### **Reference answer:**(之前给GPT4提供tutorial page和instruction, GPT4的答案)

To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such as `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.

First, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:

```python
# Import required classes from Sionna library
from sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder
```

Now, set up the encoder and decoder:

```python
# Number of information bits (input)
k = 100
# Number of codeword bits (output)
n = 200

# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder
encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)

# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type="SCL", list_size=8)
```

Using the above instances, you can now encode and decode as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode
# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)
# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode

# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode
batch_size = 10
u = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`
c = encoder(u)

# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience
# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling
# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a
# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape as codewords.
# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise

# Generate some Gaussian noise
noise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))

# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them as just the noisy codewords
llr = c + noise

# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`
u_hat = decoder(llr)
```

The `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, as noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.

运行错误的原因：

1.  import错误，不应该是sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder。而应该是sionna.fec.polar.Polar5GEncoder。

2. 类的参数错误，eg: sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type="scl")

   K, N 应该是小写；decode_type应该是 dec_type。

#### **Instruction:** Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.

#### **Finetune_answer:**  

To demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in sionna and the impact of different `table_index` values, I will guide you through a two-part process. First, I will provide code to show how to select an MCS index from the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) table based on the `table_index` and then use the MCS for a PDSCH simulation in sionna. Secondly, I will show how you can visualize the impact on the PDSCH throughput for different MCS because the throughput is an integral part of a performance evaluation of PDSCH.

### 1. MCS Selection and PDSCH Transmission in Sionna
For our demonstration, let's consider `table_index = 1` and `table_index = 2`.

First, setting up the environment:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sionna.nr import PDSCH, OFDMResourceGrid
from sionna.channel import Channel, UMiLOS, PDSCHMapping
from sionna.channel import perfect_4x4 as lego4x4
from sionna.mapping import ResourceMapper
from sionna.fec import LDPC5GalBPDecoder, LDPC5GalBPEncoder
from sionna.utils import EbN0C2No
import tensorflow as tf

# Setting up GPU, if available and ensuring TF is not allocating all memory
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)

# Simulation parameters
subcarrier_spacing = 30e3 # Hz
num_ofdm_symbols = 14
num_resource_blocks = 100

# Creating the OFDM Resource Grid for simulation
rg = OFDMResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols, 
                      num_rb=num_resource_blocks,
                      subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,
                      compute_like_nr=False)
```

Now, we create PDSCH instances with pre-configured MCS based on the `table_index`:

```python
mcs = {
    k: PDSCH.get_mcs(k, sparse_ci=True)
    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2
}

pdsch = {
    k: PDSCH(rg=rg, mcs=mcs[k])
    for k in [1, 2]  # Table Index 1 and Table Index 2
}
```

We can then show the table indices and the targeted throughput for each MCS:

```python
f"Table Index {k}: MCS with Targeted Throughput: {mcs[k].target_data_rate_mbps} Mbps"
```

### 2. Impact Analysis of MCS Table Indices on PDSCH Throughput
To visualize the effect of different `table_index` values, we'll simulate the performance of the PDSCH using the MCS provided by the different indices.

```python
import numpy as np

ebn0_db_values = np.linspace(-2, 10, 25)
block_lengths = np.array([oph.num_ue, 64, 640, 6400])

enc = LDPC5GalBPEncoder()
dec = LDPC5GalBPDecoder()

throughput = {}

for k in [1, 2]:
    alias_k = f"ti_{k}"
    pdsch_mapping = PDSCHMapping(sparse_ci=True)
    resource_mapper = ResourceMapper(rg=rg)
    
    # Model the PDSCH transmission
    @tf.function
    def pdsch_system_model(x, ebn0_db):
        channel = Channel(kind="umi_los", 
                          num_tx=4, 
                          num_rx=4,
                          return_compiled_function=True)
        
        y = channel([x, rg] + pdsch_mapping([e, no]), ebn0_db)
        llr = dec(resource_mapper([x, no, y]), ebno(ebn0_db)) # Decoding
        return llr, no

    throughputs = []
    for block_length in block_lengths:
        no = dec.compute_no([block_length, k, "5gmc", "qam"])
        e = enc.init(candidate_mcs=mcs[k])
        for ebn0_db in ebn0_db_values:
            ebn0_db = tf.constant(ebn0_db, dtype=tf.float32)
            ebno = EbN0C2No(no=no, rg=rg, block_length=block_length, k=k)
            llr, no = pdsch_system_model(e, ebn0_db)
            throughput = enc.feedback_throughput_c(rg, [e, ebno(ebn0_db)], k)
            throughputs.append(throughput)
    throughput[alias_k] = np.array(throughputs)

# Now we can plot the results.
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
```

Next, we pick specific block lengths—configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.

```python
## Continuation from the last code segment ##

# Next, we pick specific block lengths—configurations for target error rates and packet sizes.
for k in throughput:
    plt.semilogy(ebn0_db_values, throughput[k].numpy().reshape(-1, len(ebn0_db_values)), label=k)

plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("$\mathsf{E}_b/\mathsf{N}_0$ [dB]")
plt.ylabel("Throughput [Mbit/s]")
plt.title("Throughput of NR PDCCH (5G) in different scenarios with LDPC-CCA5")
plt.grid(True, which="both", linewidth=0.5)
```

This code segment will plot the throughput against the Eb/N0 for different `table_index` values to demonstrate the differences in performance. You should see the actual difference between the throughput of PDSCH based on the `table_index` used.

In the context of the provided file (in the `simulation_of_the_nrpdsch5g_cc5-using-sionna.ipynb` Notebook), please apply this guidance in the specific notebook cell identified for the task you are undertaking, following the previous code excerpts when initializing the simulation environment. It will allow you to run the simulation code and observe the impact of different MCS on PDSCH throughput.

#### Reference answer: 

To demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.

Here's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:

```python
from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs

# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index
mcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214

# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH
for table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard
    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, 
                                               table_index=table_index, 
                                               channel_type='PDSCH')
    print(f"Table Index: {table_index}")
    print(f"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}")
    print(f"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}")
    print("----------------------------------")
```

In the code above:

- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.
- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.
- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.
- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.

By running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.
