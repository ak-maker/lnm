[2, "Total Score: 18\nCoherence: 4, Relevance: 5, Groundedness: 4, Correctness: 5\n\nThe <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> answer is mostly coherent with the <Reference></Reference> answer, providing a structured method to setup multiple data stream transmissions in a MIMO setup using Sionna. It is relevant and covers the major steps outlined in the instruction and understood from the reference answer. However, there is a lack of cohesion in the flow from one step to another compared to the more connected process in the reference. The answer is grounded in the instructions but lacks some specificity in the code, especially in terms of concrete parameter values and code functionality provided in the reference. The correctness is rated partially correct because while the answer includes concepts and elements essential to MIMO data stream transmission, the precision seen in the reference answer's code snippets and explanations is lacking. The <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> provides a general guide rather than a specific, executable code explanation which makes it partially correct."]
[7, "Total Score: 12\nCoherence: 2, Relevance: 2, Groundedness: 3, Correctness: 5\n\nThe Sionna Assistant Model's answer provides a general discussion of binary and bipolar inputs in digital communications but lacks the specific details on the implementation and features within Sionna's discrete module that are provided in the Reference answer. Thus, coherence is low because it does not incorporate the details from the Reference regarding log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), the Gumbel-softmax trick, or examples of Sionna code. Relevance is similarly low because the SA does not directly address aspects of the discrete module such as handling of LLRs or channel modeling features with inputs. Groundedness earns a middle score because, while the SA answer is partly based on the context of digital modulation, it misses the connection with the practical aspects in Sionna. Correctness is scored at the middle of the range because while the SA provides correct general information on binary and bipolar inputs, it omits substantial specifics about Sionna's discrete module handling and relevant examples."]
[12, "Total Score: 7\nCoherence: 1, Relevance: 1, Groundedness: 1, Correctness: 4\n\nThe <SionnaAssistant>'s answer, while extensive, strays significantly from the succinct and targeted <Reference> answer. It overshadows necessary imports like `from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs`, which is critical for demonstrating the impact of `table_index` on the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel, making the <SionnaAssistant>'s answer incoherent with the <Reference>. The implemented methodology fails to provide the correct visualization aimed by the initial <INSTRUCTION>, resulting in low relevance and grounding scores. For correctness, the provided code by <SionnaAssistant> is operational yet overly complex and not directly addressing the <INSTRUCTION>, justifying a score of 4 due to the partial application of the tools and the limited focus on the 'table_index' parameter's impact."]
[14, "Total Score: 15\nCoherence: 3, Relevance: 3, Groundedness: 4, Correctness: 5\n\nThe <SionnaAssistant> answer provides a reasonable overview of how to implement an `OFDMSystem` class, but it lacks coherence with the <Reference> answer on specific implementation details such as the inheritance from the Keras Model class and explicit definition of layers. The relevance score is affected by the omission of direct coding examples and references to specific necessary layers, which are neatly outlined in the <Reference>. The answer is grounded but less detailed compared to the <Reference>. Correctness is moderate; the answer contains the general process of implementing the `OFDMSystem` class, but details necessary for a clear and accurate implementation, such as explicit inheritance from `tensorflow.keras.Model` and the true structure of the class, are missing."]
[17, "Total Score: 18\nCoherence: 5, Relevance: 5, Groundedness: 5, Correctness: 3\n\nBoth answers are coherent, relevant, and grounded, using identical steps and similar code structure. However, the Sionna Assistant Model's answer uses slightly different variable names and file paths, which while not affecting functionality, are not verbatim to the reference, leading to a reduction in the correctness score. The Correctness score is within the \"Limited Correct\" range because the key elements are present and functioning, but there is a difference in the naming convention of variables which could potentially lead to confusion if the user were to refer to these names elsewhere in their codebase or documentation."]
[29, "Total Score: 15\nCoherence: 3, Relevance: 3, Groundedness: 3, Correctness: 6\n\nThe <SionnaAssistant> answer is loosely coherent with the <Reference> but omits important steps such as configuration and error rate computation. It somewhat addresses the instruction but not in full. It is somewhat grounded in the instruction context but deviates in providing implementation details. The code structure resembles the reference, but there are important elements missing, like the use of LDPC code and error computation, justifying a 'Partially Correct' status."]
