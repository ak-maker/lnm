INSTRUCTION: Explain how to set up the Sionna package for Python and import essential libraries for creating a communication system simulation.
ANSWER:To set up the Sionna package for Python and import essential libraries for creating a communication system simulation, you will need to follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Install Sionna:**
   If you haven't already installed the Sionna package, you can do so using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install it:

   ```python
   pip install sionna
   ```

2. **Set GPU Configuration (Optional):**
   If you are using a machine with a GPU and want to specify which GPU to use, you can set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. If you wish to use the CPU instead, you can set this variable to an empty string. For example:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"  # Replace 0 with the GPU number you wish to use, or "" for CPU
   os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # Suppress TensorFlow logging, optional
   ```

3. **Importing Sionna:**
   After installing Sionna, you can import it into your Python code. Ensure that you handle the possible `ImportError` if Sionna is not available in the environment as shown:

   ```python
   try:
       import sionna as sn
   except ImportError as e:
       # If not installed, install the package and then import
       os.system("pip install sionna")
       import sionna as sn
   ```

   This code will attempt to import Sionna and install it using `pip` if itâ€™s not already present in the environment.

4. **Import Other Essential Libraries:**
   Aside from Sionna, you will also typically need to import TensorFlow and NumPy for matrix operations and mathematical functions, as well as other libraries such as Matplotlib for plotting. For example:

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')  # Avoid warnings from TensorFlow, optional
   import numpy as np
   %matplotlib inline
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

5. **Import TensorFlow Keras components:**
   If you're implementing custom trainable layers or models, you may need to import specific components from `tensorflow.keras`. For instance:

   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras import Model
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, Conv2D, LayerNormalization
   from tensorflow.nn import relu
   ```

   This imports the classes and functions necessary to define custom neural network layers and models.

6. **Additional Tools:**
   For saving and loading complex data structures, it's common to use the pickle library. The line for importing pickle would be:

   ```python
   import pickle
   ```

7. **Instantiate and Use Models:**
   With all the necessary libraries imported, you can now instantiate and use the communication system models provided by Sionna or define your own. For example, setting up a basic OFDM system with a learned receiver might involve instantiating a model class, setting its weights, and using it to run simulations.

   Here's a portion of code showcasing how you might load a set of pretrained weights into a neural receiver model:

   ```python
   # Assuming OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver is a predefined class representing the neural receiver
   model_neuralrx = OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver(training=False)
   
   # Run one inference to build the layers and load the weights
   model_neuralrx(tf.constant(1, tf.int32), tf.constant(10.0, tf.float32))
   
   # Load the weights from a pickle file
   with open('weights-ofdm-neuralrx', 'rb') as f:
       weights = pickle.load(f)
       model_neuralrx.set_weights(weights)
   ```

   After setting up the model, you might have a routine to compute and plot Bit Error Rate (BER) using Sionna's utility functions.

Now you have the Sionna package set up along with essential libraries you will need for creating and simulating a communication system in Python.

INSTRUCTION: Show how to enable GPU usage in a Python script for machine learning with Sionna and TensorFlow.
ANSWER:To enable GPU usage in a Python script for machine learning with Sionna and TensorFlow, you typically need to ensure that TensorFlow is set up properly to use the GPU. The script provided in your context shows that the GPU is configured with these lines of code:

```python
import os
gpu_num = 0 # Use "" to use the CPU
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = f"{gpu_num}"
```

What this snippet does is set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the specified GPU number, which TensorFlow will use to determine which GPU to run on. If you have multiple GPUs, you can change `gpu_num` to the index of the GPU you wish to use. If there is only one GPU or you want to target the first one, you'll usually set `gpu_num = 0`.

In case you want to use a different GPU, simply change the `gpu_num` to the respective GPU index (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.), according to how many GPUs are available and how they are indexed on your system.

Here's a breakdown of the steps you need to take in general:

1. Make sure that you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU with the necessary CUDA drivers installed.
2. Install the GPU version of TensorFlow (if not already installed), which typically involves installing `tensorflow-gpu` instead of `tensorflow` through pip. However, starting from TensorFlow 2.0, GPU support is included in the standard TensorFlow package.
3. Set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to tell TensorFlow which GPU to use. If you don't set this and you have more than one GPU, TensorFlow will use all available GPUs.
4. Execute your script as usual.

Remember that TensorFlow automatically takes advantage of GPU acceleration for computation if a compatible GPU is detected with all the required drivers and configurations properly installed. If your program doesn't seem to detect the GPU, you can use TensorFlow's diagnostic tools and logs to troubleshoot the issue. For example, a quick check with TensorFlow can be done by:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This code prints out the number of detected GPUs that TensorFlow can use. If it shows one or more, then TensorFlow is set up to use your GPU(s). If it returns 0, you may need to troubleshoot your installation or driver setup.

INSTRUCTION: Provide the steps to install the Sionna package in Python if it is not already installed.
ANSWER:To install the Sionna package in Python, follow these steps:

1. Open your command-line interface or terminal.
2. Execute the following command to install the Sionna package using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install sionna
   ```

If Sionna is not already installed in your environment, this command will download the package and install it along with its dependencies. If the package is already installed, `pip` will indicate that Sionna is already satisfied.

Remember, if you are using a virtual environment, ensure that it's activated before running the `pip install` command to install Sionna in the correct context. If you're using Jupyter notebooks or other Python IDEs, you can use `!pip install sionna` to run the installation command directly within a code cell.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the process of importing TensorFlow, NumPy, and other necessary libraries for building a simulation model in Sionna.
ANSWER:To build a simulation model in Sionna using TensorFlow, NumPy, and other necessary libraries, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - If you're using a system with a GPU, you might want to specify which GPU to use (if you have more than one) or to use the CPU. You can control which device TensorFlow will use with the following commands:

```python
import os
gpu_num = 0 # Use "0" for the first GPU or "" to use the CPU
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_num)
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # To avoid TensorFlow warnings
```

2. **Installing and Importing Sionna:**
   - Sionna needs to be installed if it isn't already available in your environment. You can install it using pip and then import it:

```python
try:
    import sionna as sn
except ImportError:
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna as sn
```
 
3. **Importing TensorFlow:**
   - You need to import TensorFlow, potentially setting a logging level to avoid unnecessary warning messages:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')  # You can adjust the level as needed
```

4. **Importing NumPy:**
   - NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python and is commonly used in conjunction with TensorFlow:

```python
import numpy as np
```

5. **Other Essential Libraries:**
   - You might need additional libraries for specific functionalities. For example, you may require `pickle` for object serialization and `matplotlib` for plotting:

```python
import pickle
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

6. **Importing TensorFlow Submodules and Components**: 
   - For the implementation of a neural receiver as stated in the context, you might need components from Keras (which is integrated with TensorFlow) such as the `Model` class and various types of layers:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, Conv2D, LayerNormalization
from tensorflow.nn import relu
```

With TensorFlow, NumPy, and Sionna imported, you can proceed to build your simulation model. The context provided indicates that this process involves using the Sionna library to simulate communication systems, potentially including neural network-based components for tasks such as channel estimation, equalization, and decoding.

INSTRUCTION: Outline the code to create an OFDM system class inheriting from TensorFlow's Keras Model in Sionna.
ANSWER:To create an `OFDMSystem` class that inherits from TensorFlow's Keras `Model` in Sionna, you would typically define the class in Python with the required methods for initialization and calling the model during execution. The class should be structured to define all the layers and computational steps involved in the OFDM system. Here is an outline of what the code may look like, with specific details omitted for brevity:

```python
import sionna as sn
import tensorflow as tf

class OFDMSystem(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, perfect_csi, other_parameters):
        super(OFDMSystem, self).__init__()
        self.perfect_csi = perfect_csi
        # Define other parameters (e.g., resource grid, channel model)
        # ...

        # Define the components of the OFDM system
        # Binary source, Encoder, Mapper, etc...
        self.binary_source = sn.utils.BinarySource()
        self.encoder = sn.fec.ldpc.LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)
        self.mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper("qam", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL)
        self.rg_mapper = sn.ofdm.ResourceGridMapper(RESOURCE_GRID)
        
        # Channel model including noise
        self.channel = sn.channel.OFDMChannel(CDL, RESOURCE_GRID, add_awgn=True, 
                                              normalize_channel=True, return_channel=True)
        # Include other components like channel estimators and equalizers
        self.ls_est = sn.ofdm.LSChannelEstimator(RESOURCE_GRID, interpolation_type="nn")
        self.lmmse_equ = sn.ofdm.LMMSEEqualizer(RESOURCE_GRID, STREAM_MANAGEMENT)
        
        # Demapper and decoder
        self.demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("app", "qam", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL)
        self.decoder = sn.fec.ldpc.LDPC5GDecoder(self.encoder, hard_out=True)
    
    @tf.function
    def call(self, batch_size, ebno_db):
        # Define the forward pass for the OFDM system
        # This would involve several steps including signal generation, 
        # channel processing, and signal reconstruction.
        
        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, 
                                coderate=CODERATE, resource_grid=RESOURCE_GRID)
        # Transmitter
        bits = self.binary_source([batch_size, NUM_UT,
                                  RESOURCE_GRID.num_streams_per_tx, self.k])
        codewords = self.encoder(bits)
        symbols = self.mapper(codewords)
        x_rg = self.rg_mapper(symbols)
        
        # Channel
        y, h_freq = self.channel([x_rg, no])
        
        # Receiver
        if self.perfect_csi:
            h_hat, err_var = h_freq, 0.
        else:
            h_hat, err_var = self.ls_est([y, no])
        
        x_hat, no_eff = self.lmmse_equ([y, h_hat, err_var, no])
        llr = self.demapper([x_hat, no_eff])
        bits_hat = self.decoder(llr)
        
        return bits, bits_hat
```

This outlines a class that encapsulates the processes involved in simulating an OFDM system using Sionna. It presumes you have defined and initialized the constants and settings required for the simulation such as `RESOURCE_GRID`, `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, `CODERATE`, `STREAM_MANAGEMENT`, and the channel model `CDL`.

You would also implement the necessary methods to simulate the end-to-end communication process, including generating information bits, encoding, modulation, resource grid mapping, passing the signal through the channel, performing channel estimation and equalization at the receiver, demapping, and decoding.

When using this class, you would create an instance with the proper configuration and then call the instance with the desired batch size and Eb/N0 value to simulate the OFDM system and compute performance metrics like the bit error rate (BER).

INSTRUCTION: Summarize how to define a neural receiver for an OFDM system using custom trainable layers in Sionna.
ANSWER:To define a neural receiver for an OFDM system using custom trainable layers in Sionna, follow these steps:

1. Define the custom layers required for the neural receiver. These may include convolutional layers, normalization layers, and activation functions, among others. In the provided context, the necessary TensorFlow imports, along with a Conv2D layer, LayerNormalization, and the relu activation function, suggest that such layers are relevant for the receiver's implementation.

2. Construct a class for the neural receiver by inheriting from the `tensorflow.keras.Model` or `tensorflow.keras.layers.Layer` class. Within this class, instantiate the custom layers defined earlier and outline the neural receiver's forward pass logic in the `call` method.

3. For an OFDM system, ensure that the neural receiver accounts for the specific processing steps of OFDM, such as handling the OFDM resource grid, decoding signals, and dealing with channel effects. One way to achieve this is to create an OFDM system class that includes methods to simulate the entire transmission and reception process, including the functionality of the neural receiver.

4. Ensure that any required constants or hyperparameters for the OFDM system and neural receiverâ€”such as the number of bits per symbol, code rate, and resource gridâ€”are properly defined and passed to the layers and methods as needed.

5. Use decorators such as `@tf.function` to optimize the neural receiver's components for faster execution, as seen in the provided OFDM system class example.

6. Once the neural receiver is defined, instantiate itâ€”ideally in a separate simulation or evaluation setup. Before using it for inference or training, you may need to run a dummy inference to build the layers if the weights are not yet loaded.

7. Load any pre-trained weights into the neural receiver model, if available, to initialize the neural receiver with learned parameters. This can be done using functions such as `set_weights` in combination with deserialized weight data.

8. Evaluate the neural receiver's performance through simulations, including benchmarks against traditional receiver techniques (e.g., baselines with Least Squares estimation or perfect channel state information). Use the receiver's BER (Bit Error Rate) performance as a metric to compare its effectiveness, varying the Eb/No to understand the receiver's robustness to noise.

9. Iterate over the neural receiver's design accordingly based on its performance and potential for improvement identified during simulations and benchmarks.

The provided context offers a high-level overview and supporting Python code snippets relevant to each step, particularly for setting up the simulation environment, defining an OFDM system class, and benchmarking performance. Additional implementation details, such as the architecture of the neural receiver's layers and its training process, would likely require further expansion from additional materials or documentation specifically focused on designing neural networks for communication systems in Sionna.

INSTRUCTION: Illustrate how to run a Monte-Carlo simulation to benchmark the performance of the OFDM system against different baselines.
ANSWER:Running a Monte-Carlo simulation to benchmark the performance of an OFDM system involves the following steps:

1. **Define Parameters**: Set up parameters for the OFDM system, such as the modulation scheme, FFT size, pilot configuration, channel estimation methodology (e.g., Least Squares (LS)), channel model (e.g., 3GPP), SNR or Eb/N0 range, and the number of Monte-Carlo iterations that constitute a single simulation run.

2. **System Initialization**: Initialize the OFDM system components as prescribed by the given context. This may include setting up the transmitter, channel, receiver components, and any error correction employed (e.g., LDPC encoders/decoders). The provided context outlines an OFDM System class with methods for source encoding, LDPC encoding, QAM mapping, resource grid mapping, channel simulation, channel estimation, LMMSE equalizing, LLR demapping, and LDPC decoding.

3. **Run Simulation Loop**:
   - For each Eb/N0 value:
     - Initialize error counters and set the noise level corresponding to the current Eb/N0 value.
     - Perform the Monte-Carlo simulation by running the OFDM System multiple times (typically 100 iterations as shown in the context). Each iteration simulates transmitting a batch of information bits through the channel and then receiving and processing them to estimate the transmitted bits.
     - For each iteration, generate random bit sequences, modulate them, pass the symbols through the channel, perform channel estimation and equalization, demodulate symbols back to bits, and apply decoding to retrieve the original information bits.
     - After each iteration, compare the estimated bits to the original bits to calculate Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER) counts.
     - Continue the iterations until reaching a specified number of errors or the maximum number of iterations.

4. **Collect Results**: Gather the BER and BLER results for each Eb/N0 point and visualize the performance by plotting BER against Eb/N0. The goal of the Monte-Carlo simulation is to gather statistical confidence in the system's performance under various channel conditions.

5. **Benchmark Against Baselines**: In a similar fashion to the neural receiver's performance, run the Monte Carlo simulation for other baseline receivers (e.g., with perfect CSI or using LS channel estimation) to compare their BER performance against the neural receiver. As shown in the context, baseline systems are initialized with the `OFDMSystem` class and simulated using the `simulate` method of the `PlotBER` utility from the Sionna library.

6. **Analyze Results**: Analyze the comparative plots to draw conclusions about the performance of the OFDM system with neural receiver versus that of other baseline systems. The analysis can highlight the performance gains or trade-offs associated with using a learned receiver in contrast to conventional approaches.

The actual implementation relies heavily on the code provided in the context using Sionna, TensorFlow, and related libraries. The presented code structure outlines how classes and methods are defined and employed to set up different parts of the OFDM system and run the Monte-Carlo simulation. Careful consideration of the Python code and the use of Sionna documentation can help tailor the simulation setup to specific requirements and system configurations.

INSTRUCTION: Elaborate on how to instantiate a model with a neural receiver in Sionna and load pre-trained weights.
ANSWER:To instantiate a model with a neural receiver in Sionna and load pre-trained weights, you must follow a specific series of steps. Firstly, Sionna needs to be installed, imported, and properly configured. This typically involves setting up the GPU environment and other necessary dependencies like TensorFlow and NumPy.

From the context provided, there seems to be a specific model in reference, an `OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver`, which seems like a custom model class that probably inherits TensorFlow's `Model` class and has been tailored for an OFDM system equipped with a neural receiver for end-to-end learning.

Here are the steps you need to follow based on the context provided, along with the explicit blocks of code that are crucial to perform the operation:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: In your Python environment, after configuring the hardware acceleration (GPU setup if available), import Sionna, TensorFlow, NumPy, and any other required libraries. Ensure that Sionna is installed; if not, install it using `pip install sionna`.

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pickle
```

2. **Instantiate the Model**: Instantiate the end-to-end model that includes the neural receiver. It is vital that the model has been defined elsewhere in the code. This definition includes the architecture of the neural receiver. For example:

```python
model_neuralrx = OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver(training=False)
```

3. **Build the Model**: Pass dummy or actual input data through the model to build the layers. This step is often necessary for models that dynamically set their input sizes and weights because the TensorFlow model needs to know the shape of the inputs before it can be initialized and before weights can be loaded.

```python
model_neuralrx(tf.constant(1, tf.int32), tf.constant(10.0, tf.float32))
```

4. **Load Pre-trained Weights**: Load the pre-trained weights into the model. The weights should be available in a specific format (e.g., a pickle file). You'll have to deserialize the weights file and load it into the instantiated model using its `set_weights` method.

```python
with open('weights-ofdm-neuralrx', 'rb') as f:
    weights = pickle.load(f)
    model_neuralrx.set_weights(weights)
```

After these steps, the model should be ready to evaluate with the loaded weights.

Please note that I have assumed the instantiation of `OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver` is conceptually similar to `OFDMSystem` but geared towards a model with a neural receiver. The exact class name for the neural receiver model (`OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver`) may differ in your code and should be replaced with the correct one. The file name `'weights-ofdm-neuralrx'` is also assumed to be a placeholder and should match the actual filename of your pre-trained weights.

The context provided also mentions evaluation and benchmarking, indicating that after loading the weights, you might want to run inference or further training sessions to evaluate the performance of your neural receiver model.

INSTRUCTION: Explain how to evaluate the bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) of an OFDM system equipped with a neural receiver in Sionna.
ANSWER:To evaluate the bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) of an OFDM system equipped with a neural receiver in Sionna, follow these steps, referring to the context provided when necessary:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:
   Import Sionna, TensorFlow, NumPy, and other necessary libraries. This includes layers for building the neural receiver model and utilities for BER and BLER simulations.

   ```python
   import os
   import tensorflow as tf
   import numpy as np
   import sionna as sn
   from tensorflow.keras import Model
   ```

2. **Define Your OFDM System with the Neural Receiver**:
   Create a class that defines your OFDM system with the neural receiver. This class should inherit from TensorFlow's `Model` class and include all the necessary components such as the source, encoder, mapper, channel, estimator, equalizer, demapper, and decoder.

3. **Instantiate the OFDM System for Benchmarking**:
   Instantiate the OFDM system with parameters that specify whether to use perfect channel state information (CSI) or an estimation (like LS channel estimation).

4. **Run BER and BLER Simulations**:
   Use the `PlotBER` utility in Sionna to run BER and BLER simulations. You'd call the `simulate` method on an instance of `PlotBER`, passing in the instantiated OFDM system object, a range of Eb/No values, batch size, count of target block errors, a legend label, a flag for soft estimates, max Monte-Carlo iterations, and a flag to show the resulting figure.

   ```python
   ber_plots = sn.utils.PlotBER("Neural Receiver")
   # For perfect CSI
   baseline_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)
   ber_plots.simulate(baseline_pcsi, ... )
   
   # For the neural receiver
   model_neuralrx = NeuralReceiverModel(...)
   ber_plots.simulate(model_neuralrx, ... )
   ```

   Replace the ellipsis (`...`) with the appropriate parameters as specified in the tutorial code, such as `ebno_dbs`, `batch_size`, `num_target_block_errors`, and `max_mc_iter`.

5. **Load the Trained Weights**:
   If you have a pre-trained neural receiver model, load its weights before running the BER and BLER simulations. Use pickled weights or another format as specified in the provided context, and ensure that layers of your neural receiver are built by running a dummy inference.

   ```python
   model_neuralrx = OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver(training=False)
   model_neuralrx(...)  # Run one inference to build the layers
   with open('weights-ofdm-neuralrx', 'rb') as f:
       weights = pickle.load(f)
       model_neuralrx.set_weights(weights)
   ```

6. **Collect Results and Plot**:
   After running the simulations, the BER and BLER at different Eb/No points will be printed out. Additionally, you can use the plotting features of `PlotBER` to visualize the performance of the neural receiver against the baselines.

7. **Analyze the Results**:
   Review the output table that gives you BER, BLER, bit errors, the number of bits, block errors, the number of blocks, runtime, and status for each Eb/No value. A status of "reached max iter" indicates that the simulation ran for the maximum number of iterations without reaching the target number of block errors (indicative of a good receiver), while "reached target block errors" means the simulation stopped because it reached the target number of block errors at the specified Eb/No level.

8. **Conclusions**:
   Compare the BER and BLER of the neural receiver with the baselines to assess its performance. A neural receiver that outperforms the baseline indicates a promising direction for receivers using machine learning techniques.

The instructions above provide a general guide based on the context. To fully implement and run these steps, detailed configuration like specific Eb/No range, batch sizes, and detailed class implementations would be needed based on the constructs available in the Sionna framework and the specifics of the neural receiver model used in the system.

INSTRUCTION: Guide through the procedure of using the Sionna's built-in utilities to plot the BER performance curves of different receiver configurations.
ANSWER:To plot the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance curves of different receiver configurations using Sionna's built-in utilities, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Set Up the Environment:
   - Import necessary modules from Sionna, TensorFlow, and other libraries.
   - Ensure the GPU or CPU is properly configured for computation.

2. Define the System Parameters:
   - Specify the OFDM system parameters such as the modulation scheme, coderate, and any other relevant configurations that your simulation will use.

3. Implement or Instantiate Receiver Configurations:
   - You may need to define classes or functions to represent the different receiver configurations. This can involve writing custom trainable layers or using pre-defined components in Sionna. For instance, you might have an OFDM system class with or without perfect channel state information (CSI).

4. Set Up the BER Plotting Utility:
   - Sionna provides a `PlotBER` utility which can be used to easily plot BER curves. You would instantiate this utility before running simulations.

5. Simulate Receiver Configurations:
   - For each receiver configuration, you will need to simulate its performance across a range of Eb/N0 (energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) values. This typically involves a loop where you:
     - Call the receiver configuration with a given batch size and Eb/N0 value.
     - Capture the resulting BER and BLER (Block Error Rate) metrics.

6. Plot the BER Curves:
   - Use the `PlotBER` utility instance to plot the BER performance curves, specifying the legend for each curve to differentiate between various receiver configurations.

7. Evaluate and Display Results:
   - Once the simulations are complete, you can display the figures with the plotted BER curves to compare the performance of different receivers.

Based on the context provided, you can use the following high-level pseudo-code as a reference for the actual Python code to carry out the procedure:

```python
# Step 1: Set up the environment by importing necessary libraries
import sionna as sn
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 2: Define system parameters (e.g., resource grid, modulation scheme)
# Please define the following variables as needed:
# RESOURCE_GRID, CODERATE, NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL, etc.

# Step 3: Implement or instantiate receiver configurations
# An example definition for a baseline OFDM system with least squares (LS) estimation
class OFDMSystem(sn.keras.Model):
    # ... (Define the initialization and call method here)

# Instantiate receiver configurations (e.g., OFDMSystem with perfect CSI or without)
baseline_ls = OFDMSystem(False)
baseline_pcsi = OFDMSystem(True)

# Step 4: Set up the BER plotting utility
ber_plots = sn.utils.PlotBER("Receiver Performance")

# Step 5 & 6: Simulate receiver configurations and plot BER curves
# You might need to specify EBN0_DB_MIN and EBN0_DB_MAX as the range of Eb/N0 values

for receiver in [baseline_ls, baseline_pcsi]:
    # Call the simulation function from ber_plots for the receiver
    ber_plots.simulate(receiver,
                       ebno_dbs=np.linspace(EBN0_DB_MIN, EBN0_DB_MAX, 20),
                       batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,  # Define BATCH_SIZE as needed
                       num_target_block_errors=100,
                       legend=f"Receiver: {receiver.description}",  # Customize legend
