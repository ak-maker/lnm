INSTRUCTION: Explain how to simulate a lumped amplification optical channel using the Sionna Python package.
ANSWER:To simulate a lumped amplification optical channel using the Sionna Python package, follow these general steps, referencing the given context for more detailed code examples where helpful:

1. **Setup the Environment:**
   Begin by configuring your Python environment to use Sionna. Import required packages including Sionna, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib for visualization purposes. If Sionna is not installed, you need to install it first.

2. **Parameter Initialization:**
   Define your simulation parameters such as the simulation time window (`t_sim`), the number of simulation samples (`n_sim`), and the impulse parameters like peak power (`p_0`) and pulse duration (`t_0`). Also, define your channel parameters like the number of spans (`n_span`). Initialize the time and frequency vectors using the `sionna.channel.utils.time_frequency_vector()` function.

3. **Impulse Generation:**
   Create your Gaussian impulse signal using the equation provided in the context, with `t` being the time vector and `p_0` and `t_0` as defined parameters.

4. **Configure the Channel:**
   You need to normalize units for your simulation, so decide on time and distance normalization factors. Define fiber parameters such as carrier frequency (`f_c`), fiber span length (`length_sp`), and fiber attenuation (`alpha`). For Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA), specify the amplifier gain (`g_edfa`) and noise figure (`f_edfa`). 

5. **Instantiate Channel Components:**
   Create instances of the `SSFM` layer (Single Span Fiber Model) representing spans of the optical fiber and the `EDFA` representing the amplifiers. When creating the `SSFM` instance, decide if you want to enable or disable various impairments such as amplification, attenuation, dispersion, and nonlinearity. In the given context, everything but attenuation is disabled for the initial experiment.

6. **Define the Lumped Amplification Channel:**
   Create a function `lumped_amplification_channel` (as shown in the context) that takes in an input signal and sequentially propagates it through each fiber span and amplifier. This typically involves a loop where each iteration represents propagation through one span and one amplifier.

7. **Simulate the Signal Transmission:**
   Send the created Gaussian impulse through the lumped amplification channel by calling the function with your impulse as an argument to get the output signal. Here, the input signal `x` represents the Gaussian impulse to be transmitted, and `y` is the received signal after channel propagation.

8. **Visualize the Results:**
   Generate spectral representations of the transmitted and received signals and plot these alongside their time-domain presentations to analyze the effects of the channel. Use Matplotlib for plotting the comparison between the transmitted pulse and the received pulse in both time and frequency domains.

9. **Analyze the Output:**
   Assess the noise introduced by the amplifiers and the compensation of attenuation by comparing the transmitted (`x`) and received (`y`) signals. The simulation context will show whether attenuation has been completely compensated and if any significant noise is visible.

These steps provide a framework for the Sionna-based simulation of an optical communication channel. Actual implementations may require fine-tuning of the simulation parameters and additional considerations depending on the specific objectives of the simulation study.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the process of setting up the simulation environment, including configuring the GPU and importing necessary modules like `os`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
ANSWER:To set up the simulation environment that includes configuring the GPU and importing necessary modules like `os`, `tensorflow`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, you would follow these steps:

1. **Set the GPU device**:
   Begin by defining which GPU you want to use for your tensorflow operations, if any. If a GPU is available and you want to use it, you can set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to the GPU number, typically `"0"` for the first GPU. If you prefer to run on CPU, you would set this to an empty string (`""`).

   ```python
   import os
   gpu_num = 0  # or "" for CPU
   os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_num)
   # Suppress TensorFlow's logging to only output errors
   os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
   ```

2. **Configure TensorFlow for GPU usage**:
   TensorFlow needs to be configured to use the GPU. This means, among other things, setting it to only allocate memory as needed rather than grabbing all available GPU memory.

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
   if gpus:
       try:
           # Set memory growth to true to allocate only as much GPU memory as needed
           tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
       except RuntimeError as e:
           # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized
           print(e)
   # Set TensorFlow logger to output only error messages
   tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
   ```

3. **Import Sionna**:
   Sionna is a specific library that you might need for optical channel simulation. If it's not installed, it should be installed first.

   ```python
   try:
       import sionna
   except ImportError as e:
       # Install Sionna if the package is not already installed
       os.system("pip install sionna")
       import sionna
   from sionna.channel import utils
   ```

4. **Import other necessary Python packages**:
   Essential data science and plotting libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib should be imported. 

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   # Enable Matplotlib plotting inline within the notebook
   %matplotlib inline
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

5. **Initialize the simulation parameters:**
   Before running any simulation, you need to set various simulation parameters. Based on the context, this also involves setting up the simulation time window, number of samples, and impulse parameters, as well as generating the Gaussian impulse.

   ```python
   # Simulation parameters
   dtype = tf.complex128  # Define simulation accuracy (double precision complex numbers)
   t_sim = int(1e4)  
   n_sim = int(1e4)  
   # Impulse parameters
   p_0 = 3e-2  
   t_0 = 50  
   dt = t_sim / n_sim  
   # Generate time and frequency vectors using utils from Sionna
   t, f = utils.time_frequency_vector(n_sim, dt, dtype=dtype.real_dtype)
   ```

6. **Perform additional tasks**:
   Depending on the simulation, you might need to define the lumped amplification channel model or run the signal through an optical channel model. This involves setting up an optical channel model and a lumped amplification channel model in Sionna, as seen in the provided code snippet.

After completing these steps, your simulation environment would be correctly set up, with the GPU configured for TensorFlow, and all necessary Python libraries loaded and ready for your simulation task.

INSTRUCTION: Explain how to generate a single Gaussian impulse for transmission over an optical channel, including defining simulation and impulse parameters.
ANSWER:To generate a single Gaussian impulse for transmission over an optical channel and simulate its propagation, we need to define the simulation and impulse parameters and follow several steps. Here's a guide based on the given context:

**1. Define the simulation parameters:**

- Simulation time window (`t_sim`): This is the length of the simulated time for which the impulse will propagate. It's set to `1000 ps` (picoseconds).
- Sample duration (`dt`): This is the temporal resolution of the simulation. For the example provided, it is `1 ps`.

**2. Define the impulse parameters:**

- Peak power (`P_0`): The maximum power of the Gaussian impulse.
- Pulse duration (`T_0`): The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian pulse, indicating its temporal width.

**3. Generate the Gaussian impulse:**

A Gaussian impulse `g(t)` can be written mathematically as:

\[g(t) = \sqrt{P_0 \cdot 2^{-\left(\frac{2t}{T_0}\right)^2}}\]

You can generate the time vector `t` and subsequently the Gaussian impulse using Python code. For instance:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Impulse parameters
p_0 = 3e-2     # Example: 0.03 W (Watts)
t_0 = 50       # Example: 50 ps (picoseconds)

# Simulation parameters
t_sim = 1e3    # Example: 1000 ps (picoseconds)
n_sim = 1e3    # Example: 1000 samples
dt = t_sim / n_sim  # Sample duration (time interval between samples)

# Generate time vector
t = np.linspace(-t_sim/2, t_sim/2, int(n_sim))

# Generate Gaussian impulse
g_0 = np.sqrt(p_0 * np.exp(-((2.0 * t / t_0) ** 2.0)))
```

**4. Perform the transmission over the optical channel:**

- You would typically use a sophisticated channel model that includes various impairments such as attenuation, dispersion, and nonlinearity. For simplicity, some of these effects may be disabled as in the example given.
- In the context provided, lumped amplification using Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) with a gain `G` and noise figure `F` is considered. You would simulate the effect of these amplifiers on your signal.

**5. Visualize the transmitted and received signal:**

Using a visualization library like `matplotlib`, you can plot the magnitude of the transmitted and received Gaussian impulses in both time and frequency domain to analyze the impact of the optical channel.

Here's an example of how you might visualize the transmitted impulse:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the impulse in the time domain
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(t, np.abs(g_0)**2)
plt.xlim(-150, 150)
plt.xlabel("Time (ps)")
plt.ylabel("Power (W)")
plt.title("Gaussian Impulse in Time Domain")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

Please note that the pseudocode snippets provided are meant to illustrate the steps and are based on the information given in the context. The actual parameters (`P_0`, `T_0`, `t_sim`, etc.) would be defined based on your specific requirements. Moreover, the actual transmission over the optical channel would require the channel model to be instantiated and used, as suggested by the provided context.

INSTRUCTION: Discuss the significance of the fiber span length, amplifier gain, and noise figure when setting up an optical channel with lumped amplification.
ANSWER:In setting up an optical channel with lumped amplification, several parameters are critical to achieving intended performance outcomes. These parameters include the fiber span length, amplifier gain, and noise figure. Their significance can be understood as follows:

1. **Fiber Span Length $(\ell_\text{span})$:**
The fiber span length is the physical distance between two optical amplifiers along the fiber link. This distance impacts the signal as it will experience attenuation over the course of the fiber. In essence, the longer the span, the more the signal will be attenuated, requiring higher gain from the amplifier to restore the signal level. However, increasing the span length can also increase the effects of dispersion and nonlinearity, which can degrade the signal quality. Therefore, an optimal fiber span length must balance the need for signal boost (to overcome attenuation) and the desire to minimize signal distortion.

2. **Amplifier Gain $(G)$:**
Amplifier gain is the measure of a signal's power increase provided by an amplifier. It is critical to set the gain to a level that compensates for the attenuated signal across the fiber span length but does not introduce clipping or saturation of the amplifier. Striking the right balance ensures that the signal at the end of the span has the same power level as at the beginning, which is referred to as making the link transparent. In the context of the code, `g_edfa` is determined by taking the exponential of the product of the attenuation constant $\alpha$ and the normalized fiber span length `length_sp`, representing just such a compensation.

3. **Noise Figure $(F)$:**
The noise figure characterizes the noise performance of an amplifier, especially important in optical communications where signals are typically weak and can be easily swamped by noise. A low noise figure is preferred as it indicates that the amplifier adds relatively less noise to the signal. Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) noise is particularly important as it represents the fundamental noise added by Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs). The noise power $(P_\mathrm{ASE})$ associated with ASE depends on the gain $(G)$, noise figure $(F)$, and the carrier frequency $(f_\text{c})$, among other factors. It is introduced by each amplifier in the link, accumulated over the spans. High noise levels can degrade signal integrity and impact the fidelity of the transmitted data, underscoring the importance of a low-noise figure.

In the provided context, ASE noise is determined by the use of `g_edfa` for gain and `f_edfa` for the noise figure. The noise power spectral density $\rho_\mathrm{ASE}$ is directly proportional to the product of these two variables and Planck's constant.

These three parameters—fiber span length, amplifier gain, and noise figure—are closely interlinked and must be carefully optimized in any optical channel design to manage signal attenuation, noise accumulation, and potential signal distortion. Designing a fiber optic link involves iterative adjustments of these parameters to ensure that the optical channel performs within acceptable thresholds for the intended communication standards.

INSTRUCTION: Provide guidance on creating and configuring a fiber span without nonlinearity and chromatic dispersion using Sionna's `SSFM` class.
ANSWER:To create and configure a fiber span without nonlinearity and chromatic dispersion using Sionna's `SSFM` class, you need to follow these steps, with considerations relevant to the given context:

1. **Initialization**: As seen in the context, you must import the necessary libraries and set up the TensorFlow environment to correctly use the GPU or CPU as needed. This also includes setting the logging level to avoid unnecessary TensorFlow warnings.

2. **SSFM Configuration**: The `SSFM` (Split-Step Fourier Method) class in Sionna is used to simulate the propagation of optical signals through a fiber span. To disable nonlinearity and chromatic dispersion, you must set the corresponding parameters `with_nonlinearity` and `with_dispersion` to `False` in the `SSFM` class.

3. **Define the Fiber Span Length and Simulation Parameters**: The length of the fiber span (`length`) and the sample duration (`sample_duration`) are important parameters that you should define according to your simulation needs. In the context, `length_sp` represents the normalized fiber span length and `dt` represents the sample duration, both of which you would use when instantiating the `SSFM` class.

4. **Instantiate the SSFM Class**: Instantiate the `SSFM` class with the desired configuration.

The code snippet from the context that is relevant to the SSFM configuration looks something like this:

```python
# Normalization constants
t_norm = 1e-12  # (s) -> (ps) Time normalization
z_norm = 1e3  # (m) -> (km) Distance normalization

# Instantiate the SSFM class with desired parameters
span = sionna.channel.optical.SSFM(
            alpha=alpha,
            f_c=f_c,
            length=length_sp,
            sample_duration=dt,
            with_amplification=False,
            with_attenuation=True,
            with_dispersion=False,    # Disable chromatic dispersion
            with_nonlinearity=False,  # Disable nonlinearity
            dtype=dtype,
            t_norm=t_norm)
```

In this context:
- `alpha` is the attenuation constant for the fiber,
- `f_c` is the carrier frequency,
- `length_sp` is the normalized span length,
- `dt` is the sample duration,
- `dtype` is the data type for computation (chosen as `tf.complex128` for high precision),
- `with_attenuation=True` means that attenuation is enabled,
- `with_dispersion=False` ensures that chromatic dispersion is disabled,
- `with_nonlinearity=False` ensures that nonlinearity is disabled,
- `t_norm` is provided to normalize the temporal scale.

5. **Simulate Propagation**: Use the instantiated `SSFM` class to simulate signal propagation across the fiber span. The signal to be propagated should be defined (such as `g_0`, the Gaussian impulse from the context).

6. **Visualize Results**: After the simulation, visualize your results by plotting the signal's power in time and frequency domains to verify that the fiber span configuration behaves as expected.

Remember that the snippet above assumes certain variables (`dtype`, `t_norm`, etc.) are already defined and certain imports (`sionna`, etc.) have been made, which was shown at the beginning of the context. Attention should be paid to ensure that the units for all parameters are consistent and normalized if necessary to prevent scaling issues.

INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate how to instantiate an Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) using Sionna's `EDFA` class with specified gain and noise figure.
ANSWER:To instantiate an Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) using Sionna's `EDFA` class with a given gain and noise figure, you can follow steps similar to the ones shown in the provided context. Assuming the necessary variables such as `gain` and `noise_figure` for the EDFA, the carrier frequency (`f_c`), and the sample duration (`dt`) are already defined, you can create an instance of `EDFA` as demonstrated below.

First, import the `EDFA` class from Sionna:
```python
from sionna.channel.optical import EDFA
```

Then, you may define the gain and noise figure as given in your requirements:
```python
gain = <Desired_gain_value>  # Replace with a specific gain value
noise_figure = <Desired_noise_figure_value>  # Replace with a specific noise figure value
```

Instantiate the EDFA with the specified gain and noise figure. It is essential to include the frequency (`f_c`) and the sample duration (`dt`):
```python
edfa_instance = EDFA(
    g=gain,
    f=noise_figure,
    f_c=f_c,
    dt=dt,
    dtype=dtype
)
```
In this code:

- `gain` is the amplifier gain.
- `noise_figure` is the noise figure of the EDFA.
- `f_c` is the carrier frequency, which would normally be defined elsewhere in the code.
- `dt` is the sample duration, which would also be defined elsewhere in the code.
- `dtype` is the data type for simulation precision and would need to be defined similarly as in the code.

Please replace `<Desired_gain_value>` and `<Desired_noise_figure_value>` with the specific values for gain and noise figure that you wish to set for the EDFA instance.

In the context provided, the variables `g_edfa` and `f_edfa` seem to represent the gain and noise figure, respectively, and are used during the instantiation of the `EDFA` object. If you are working with the provided context directly, you may not need to define the gain and noise figure separately but instead use these existing variables.

Remember that this example assumes that you have already set up your environment with the required imports and definitions as per the context provided. If not, you will need to ensure these steps are completed before you can instantiate the `EDFA`.

INSTRUCTION: Illustrate how to create a lumped amplification channel function that simulates transmission through multiple fiber spans and EDFAs.
ANSWER:To create a lumped amplification channel function that simulates transmission through multiple fiber spans and Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs), you would take the following steps, as illustrated in the provided context:

1. **Setup the environment**: Import needed libraries and configure the environment to use the appropriate processing device (CPU or GPU) and suppress warnings if necessary. Within the context, TensorFlow and Sionna are imported to simulate the optical channel. A GPU is selected for the task, and TensorFlow's logging level is set to 'ERROR' to avoid unnecessary warnings.

2. **Simulation parameters**: Determine the parameters for the simulation, including the characteristics of the Gaussian impulse that represents the optical signal, simulation time window, sample duration, and so on.

3. **Generating the Gaussian Impulse**: Use the given formula for generating a Gaussian impulse with peak power $P_0$ and pulse duration $T_0$. Create time and frequency vectors needed for the simulation, and then generate the Gaussian impulse using the provided parameters.

4. **Configure the channel**: Set the parameters for the optical fiber such as carrier frequency, fiber span length, and fiber attenuation ($\alpha$). Similarly, set the EDFA parameters like amplifier gain $G$ and noise figure $F$. These values are usually provided by the problem you are working on or by the specific hardware you are simulating.

5. **Create the fiber spans and EDFAs**: Use Sionna to instantiate an `SSFM` layer for the Split-Step Fourier Method, which is applied to simulate the propagation of the impulse through the fiber. The `EDFA` component simulates the optical amplifiers. Configure these components with parameters appropriate for your simulation (e.g., enabling/disabling effects like attenuation, amplification, dispersion, and nonlinearity based on what you aim to study). 

6. **Lumped amplification channel function**: Define a Python function that accepts the input signal and propagates it through multiple spans of fiber and amplifiers simulating the optical transmission. The function should loop over the number of spans, applying the `span` function (fiber) followed by the `amplifier` function (EDFA) for each span.

7. **Transmission and visualization**: Pass the initial Gaussian impulse through the lumped amplification channel function to simulate transmission. After the signal has been transmitted through the channel, visualize the received impulse in both time and frequency domains alongside the transmitted impulse to understand the effects of the channel, especially the attenuation compensated by EDFAs and the noise introduced by the amplifiers.

8. **Interpreting results**: Observe the final results and performance of the system from the plots, noting that the ideal goal is to have a received signal that is as close as possible to the transmitted signal, considering both the amplitude and the introduced noise.

The essential part of the Python code to create the lumped amplification channel, simulate the transmission, and visualize the results is as follows:

```python
span = sionna.channel.optical.SSFM(
            alpha=alpha,
            f_c=f_c,
            length=length_sp,
            sample_duration=dt,
            with_amplification=False,
            with_attenuation=True,
            with_dispersion=False,
            with_nonlinearity=False,
            dtype=dtype,
            t_norm=t_norm)

amplifier = sionna.channel.optical.EDFA(
            g=g_edfa,
            f=f_edfa,
            f_c=f_c,
            dt=dt * t_norm,  # t_norm is in absolute (not normalized) units
            dtype=dtype)

def lumped_amplification_channel(inputs):
    (u_0) = inputs
    u = u_0
    for _ in range(n_span):
        u = span(u)
        u = amplifier(u)
    return u
```

Please note that this snippet of code details the relevant components involved in implementing the lumped amplification channel based on the context provided. The actual implementation may require further steps, such as initializing variables and parameters, handling data type conversions, executing the simulation, and plotting the resulting signals.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the process of transmitting an impulse through the optical channel and visualizing the input and output optical signals in both time and frequency domains.
ANSWER:The process of transmitting an impulse through an optical channel with lumped amplification and visualizing the input and output optical signals in both the time and frequency domains can be described as follows:

1. **Impulse Generation**: First, an initial Gaussian optical impulse is generated. This impulse is defined by its peak power ($P_0$) and pulse duration ($T_0$). In this context, the Gaussian impulse is mathematically described as:
   
   $$
   g(t) = \sqrt{P_0 \cdot 2^{(-\left(\frac{2t}{T_0}\right)^2)}}
   $$

   with $t$ being time, and the Gaussian function determines the shape of the optical pulse in the time domain. The simulation window ($T_{\mathrm{sim}}$) and the sample duration ($\Delta_t$) are set to provide a discrete representation of the signal for processing.

2. **Channel Setup**: The channel consists of multiple spans of standard single-mode fiber (S-SMF) with Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) positioned at the end of each fiber span. The fiber length between two amplifiers is denoted by $\ell_{\text{span}}$. Each amplifier has a gain $G$ and a noise figure $F$.

3. **Attenuation**: The channel introduces attenuation, quantified by a parameter $\alpha$. This weakening of the signal is compensated by the optical amplifiers (EDFAs), which amplify the signal to counteract the losses incurred during transmission through the fiber spans.

4. **Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) Noise**: In addition to signal amplification, the EDFAs introduce ASE noise into the channel, which degrades the quality of the transmitted signal. The ASE noise is dependent on the amplifier gain, noise figure, carrier frequency, and the simulation bandwidth.

5. **Channel Transmission**: The input optical signal, which is the generated impulse, is then transmitted through the fiber-spans and EDFAs. The function `lumped_amplification_channel` represents the transmission process where the impulse is propagated through the number of defined spans, with each span followed by an EDFA. The signal `u` is updated at each span and amplifier, resulting in the output signal.

6. **Visualization**: After transmission through the optical channel, the output optical signal is visualized in both the time and frequency domains. This is done by plotting the absolute squared value of the impulse in the time domain. For the frequency domain visualization, the Fourier transform of the impulse is calculated and the magnitude squared is plotted.

The following code snippets from the context are essential to execute and visualize the process described above:

- Generating the Gaussian impulse and visualizing it in the time and frequency domains:
  ```python
  g_0 = np.sqrt(p_0 * 2**(-((2.0*t / t_0) ** 2.0)))
  G_0 = tf.signal.fftshift(tf.abs(tf.cast(dt, dtype) * tf.signal.fft(g_0) / tf.cast(tf.math.sqrt(2 * np.pi), dtype)) ** 2)
  ```
- Simulating the channel with the lumped amplification and the corresponding visualization:
  ```python
  x = g_0
  y = lumped_amplification_channel(x)
  X = tf.signal.fftshift(tf.abs(tf.cast(dt, dtype) * tf.signal.fft(x) / tf.cast(tf.math.sqrt(2 * np.pi), dtype)) ** 2)
  Y = tf.signal.fftshift(tf.abs(tf.cast(dt, dtype) * tf.signal.fft(y) / tf.cast(tf.math.sqrt(2 * np.pi), dtype)) ** 2)
  ```

These visualizations allow one to observe the changes in the signal in both the time and frequency domains due to the transmission through the optical channel, as well as the noise added by the EDFAs. As seen from the context, the code provided is used to plot the input (transmitted) and the output (received) signals after the channel transmission to compare their characteristics and observe the effects of attenuation and the ASE noise introduced by the EDFAs.

INSTRUCTION: Conclude by explaining how to interpret the visualized data to assess the impact of attenuation and the noise introduced by the EDFAs on the transmitted optical signal.
ANSWER:To interpret the visualized data for assessing the impact of attenuation and the noise introduced by Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) on the transmitted optical signal, you need to follow these steps:

1. Attenuation Compensation: Examine the visualizations that compare the transmitted and received optical signals' power over time. The solid line represents the transmitted signal, and the dashed line represents the received signal after traveling through the optical channel with lumped amplification. If the attenuation caused by the optical fiber is entirely compensated by the amplifiers, the peak of the received signal should be at the same power level as the transmitted signal.

2. Noise Analysis: Observe the noise floor level in the received signal's power visualization. An increase in the baseline signal power, not associated with the main pulse's power, indicates the presence of noise introduced by EDFAs. The noise floor should be significantly lower in the transmitted signal's plot, showcasing the impact of the amplifiers.

3. Frequency Domain Analysis: Inspect the spectral domain plots showing the power spectral density (PSD) of both transmitted (solid line) and received (dashed line) signals. In the absence of dispersion and nonlinearity, the shape of the spectrum should remain relatively unchanged if the amplification fully compensates for attenuation. Look for broadening of the received signal's spectrum, which can indicate noise accumulation over multiple spans, and a rise in the noise floor level due to the ASE noise introduced by EDFAs.

4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Consider calculating the SNR in the frequency domain by dividing the power of the received signal's spectrum by the noise power at different frequency bins. Reductions in SNR can be attributed to EDFA noise, and by inspecting the changes in SNR across the spectrum, you can deduce the frequency regions most affected by ASE noise.

In the provided context, the impact of optical fiber attenuation is equalized by EDFAs using amplifier gain, but they inevitably introduce noise, mainly ASE noise. By carefully analyzing the time-domain and frequency-domain representations of the optical signal before and after transmission, you can assess the effective compensation of attenuation and the extent of noise introduced. Key indicators of EDFA noise include a raised noise floor in the time domain and a broader or higher baseline in the PSD of the received signal in the frequency domain. Calculating the SNR across the spectrum can offer a quantitative measure of noise impact.

Remember, while interpreting your data, it is essential to keep in mind the setup parameters (like amplifier gain, noise figure, etc.), the specific contributions of the EDFAs, and the fact that the visualizations and calculations exclude other sources of noise and impairments such as shot noise or dispersion, which are neglected in this demonstration.
