INSTRUCTION: Explain what an end-to-end communication system implemented as an autoencoder is and how it can be applied using the Sionna Python package.
ANSWER:An end-to-end communication system implemented as an autoencoder is an approach that uses deep learning models to design and optimize the entire communication pipeline, from the transmitter to the receiver. This methodology treats the communication system as a single, unified system to be optimized for performance, adapting to the specific characteristics of the channel and signal processing elements involved.

In such an autoencoder-based communication system, the transmitter encodes input messages and modulates them into signals suitable for transmission over a channel. These signals traverse the channel, where they are affected by noise and other impairing factors—in this case, an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered. The receiver then demodulates and decodes the received signals to retrieve the transmitted messages. By employing neural networks at both the transmitter and receiver ends, the autoencoder system learns to communicate effectively over the channel, optimizing the constellation geometry and bit labeling at the transmitter and the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) computation for demapping at the receiver.

The Sionna Python package, being a library for simulating and evaluating communication systems, offers tools and functionalities for implementing and training such autoencoder systems. With Sionna, you can define custom transmitter and receiver architectures, simulate the AWGN channel, and perform bit error rate (BER) or block error rate (BLER) evaluations.

In the context provided, two algorithms are used to train the autoencoder:

1. Conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation, where a differentiable channel model allows for end-to-end optimization by backpropagating the gradients through the channel.
2. A training algorithm that doesn't require a differentiable channel model, which alternates between conventional training of the receiver and reinforcement learning (RL)-based training of the transmitter. Subsequently, fine-tuning of the receiver is performed after the alternating training.

Using Sionna, a baseline system is created using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with Gray labeling and conventional demapping for the AWGN channel. The provided Python code snippet demonstrates how to set up the baseline system using Sionna's classes and functions. For example, `Baseline` is a TensorFlow model that includes a binary source, an encoder, a mapper, an AWGN channel, a demapper, and a decoder, reflecting the components of a communication system.

To evaluate the performance of the different systems (baseline and the two autoencoder-based systems trained with SGD and RL), the `sim_ber` function from Sionna's `utils` module is used. The function computes the BER/BLER over a range of SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) values, given in `ebno_dbs` (Eb/N0 in decibels). The performance results are stored in a dictionary called `BLER`, and the Python code snippet provided in the context reflects how the evaluation process is conducted.

Lastly, results are visualized in performance curves using `matplotlib`, comparing the BLER across different SNR values for the baseline system versus the autoencoder-based systems with different training strategies. The visualization provides insight into how well the system performs in comparison to traditional methods and the impact of the different training algorithms on system performance.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the two algorithms that can be used for training an autoencoder-based communication system within Sionna, highlighting the key differences in their methodologies.
ANSWER:In the provided Sionna notebook context, two algorithms for training an autoencoder-based communication system are described:

1. **Conventional Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Backpropagation:**
    - This training algorithm leverages the concept of an end-to-end optimizable communication system using a neural network autoencoder.
    - The autoencoder architecture includes both the transmitter and the receiver, and it is jointly optimized to minimize the reconstruction error across the communication channel.
    - SGD with backpropagation relies on a differentiable channel model. It means that the mathematical model of the communication channel must have a well-defined gradient.
    - Training happens by updating the autoencoder weights based on the computed gradients that flow back through the channel from the receiver to the transmitter. This requires that the whole system (transmitter, channel, and receiver) is differentiable so that the gradients from the loss function can be propagated back to the transmitter.
    - Example: If using an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, its effect can be modeled and differentiated, allowing for backpropagation to work.

2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Training Algorithm:**
    - This training algorithm addresses scenarios where the channel model isn’t differentiable, which is often the case in real-world communication systems.
    - In contrast to SGD with backpropagation, this method does not require gradient computation through the channel. Instead, it uses a model-free approach.
    - The training consists of alternating phases:
        a. Conventional training of the receiver is performed using methods similar to those in the first algorithm (e.g., backpropagation).
        b. RL-based training of the transmitter does not rely on gradients. Instead, it leverages reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the transmitter by using feedback on the performance without needing to differentiate the channel.
    - After the alternating training, an additional step of fine-tuning the receiver is carried out to further improve performance.
    - It is a hybrid approach that combines supervised learning for the receiver and RL for the transmitter, which is particularly beneficial when facing non-differentiable channels or environments.

The key difference between the two methodologies is their handling of the channel model. The first method requires a differentiable channel to propagate gradients, while the second method uses a model-free approach through RL, removing the need for a differentiable channel and allowing training in more complex or unknown channel conditions.

INSTRUCTION: Confirm the necessity of going through Part 2 of the Sionna tutorial for beginners to understand the optimization of differentiable communication systems through SGD and backpropagation.
ANSWER:Based on the context provided, going through Part 2 of the Sionna tutorial for beginners appears to be necessary if one wishes to understand the optimization of differentiable communication systems through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and backpropagation. This necessity is confirmed by the context stating:

**Note:** For an introduction to the implementation of differentiable communication systems and their optimization through SGD and backpropagation with Sionna, please refer to [the Part 2 of the Sionna tutorial for Beginners](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/examples/Sionna_tutorial_part2.html).

Given this note suggests Part 2 of the tutorial as an introduction to the concepts in question, it is reasonable to conclude that this part of the tutorial contains fundamental information that would be necessary for a proper understanding of how SGD and backpropagation are applied to optimize such systems within the Sionna framework.

INSTRUCTION: Summarize the steps for configuring the GPU and TensorFlow environment in a Python notebook for using Sionna.
ANSWER:To configure the GPU and TensorFlow environment in a Python notebook for using Sionna, follow these steps:

1. First, set the environment variables to specify which GPU to use and to suppress some TensorFlow warnings:
   ```python
   import os
   gpu_num = 0 # Use "0" for the first GPU, or an empty string for CPU
   os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_num)
   os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # Suppresses some TensorFlow logging
   ```

2. Check if Sionna is already installed in your environment, and if not, install it:
   ```python
   try:
       import sionna
   except ImportError as e:
       # Install Sionna if the package is not already installed
       os.system("pip install sionna")
       import sionna
   ```

3. Configure TensorFlow to use only one GPU and to allocate only as much memory as needed:
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
   if gpus:
       try:
           # Set memory growth to true to allocate only as much GPU memory as needed
           tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
       except RuntimeError as e:
           # Catching the runtime error in case memory growth cannot be set
           print(e)
   # Setting TensorFlow logger level to ERROR to avoid some warnings
   tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
   ```

4. Import any other necessary modules and functions from TensorFlow and Sionna for your project requirements.

By following these steps, you have set up a Python notebook to use a specific GPU (if available) and to work with Sionna and TensorFlow. The GPU is configured to allocate memory as per the computation requirements dynamically, which should help prevent memory over-allocation issues.

INSTRUCTION: Provide a Python code snippet that shows how to set up the necessary imports and configuration to utilize Sionna for simulating AWGN channels.
ANSWER:To set up the necessary imports and configuration to utilize Sionna for simulating AWGN channels in a Python environment, you would need to take the following steps in your Python code. Please note that this code snippet includes essential imports and does not assume installation of dependencies, except for TensorFlow which is usually a prerequisite for using Sionna. The detailed configuration such as GPU management is omitted as it might not relate directly to the simulation of AWGN channels.

First, make sure that Sionna is installed:
```python
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError:
    # If Sionna is not installed, install it using pip
    !pip install sionna
    import sionna
```

Then proceed with importing Sionna's AWGN channel module and any other utilities you might need, like so:
```python
# Import the AWGN channel class from Sionna
from sionna.channel import AWGN

# Import any other utilities you might need
from sionna.utils import ebnodb2no
```

This sets up the minimal imports necessary for simulating AWGN channels with Sionna. If you're planning on simulating specific scenarios involving certain modulation schemes or error metrics, make sure to import the relevant modules accordingly.

For instance, if you plan to use Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation and to compute the Bit Error Rate (BER), your imports would look something like this:
```python
# Utility functions and other imports for Sionna simulations
from sionna.utils import BinarySource, sim_ber
from sionna.mapping import Mapper, Constellation

# Create instances of the utilities
binary_source = BinarySource()
constellation = Constellation("bpsk")
mapper = Mapper(constellation=constellation)
awgn_channel = AWGN()

# Suppose you have a signal to send, for the sake of example:
# signal -> your modulated signal, a TensorFlow tensor.
# ebno_db -> Eb/N0 value in dB, as a floating-point number or a TensorFlow tensor.
# ... your code for generating/modulating the signal ...

# Now use `ebnodb2no` to calculate the noise variance from Eb/N0 in dB
noise_variance = ebnodb2no(ebno_db)

# Simulate the AWGN channel
noisy_signal = awgn_channel([signal, noise_variance])

# ... further processing, demodulation, and BER computation as needed ...
```

Remember this is only a foundational setup; you will need to customize and expand upon it to create a full end-to-end communication system simulation based on your specific requirements and research objectives.

INSTRUCTION: Outline the workflow to define a `Baseline` class that models a communication system using QAM with Gray labeling and conventional demapping for an AWGN channel in Sionna.
ANSWER:To define a `Baseline` class in Sionna that models a communication system using QAM with Gray labeling and conventional demapping for an AWGN channel, you can follow this workflow:

1. **Import necessary modules and classes from Sionna:**
   Ensure that you have all the necessary imports such as `BinarySource`, `AWGN`, `Mapper`, `Demapper`, `Constellation`, etc.

2. **Define the Constellation object:**
   You need to create a `Constellation` object that describes the QAM constellation with Gray labeling. For example, for a 16-QAM modulation scheme, you can use:

   ```python
   constellation = Constellation("qam", num_bits_per_symbol, trainable=False)
   ```

   Ensure that `num_bits_per_symbol` correctly represents the bits per QAM symbol (e.g., 4 bits for 16-QAM).

3. **Configure the LDPC Encoder and Decoder:**
   Implement the LDPC encoder and decoder to handle the coding and decoding processes. You'll use the `LDPC5GEncoder` and `LDPC5GDecoder` classes provided by Sionna. You must specify the encoder parameters such as `k`, `n`, and `num_bits_per_symbol`.

   ```python
   self._encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n, num_bits_per_symbol)
   self._decoder = LDPC5GDecoder(self._encoder, hard_out=True)
   ```

4. **Create the Mapper and Demapper objects:**
   Instantiate objects from the `Mapper` and `Demapper` classes. These will be responsible for converting binary encoded data into constellation points and vice versa.

   ```python
   self._mapper = Mapper(constellation=constellation)
   self._demapper = Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)
   ```

5. **Initialize the Channel object:**
   Create an AWGN channel object that simulates the physical transmission medium by adding Gaussian noise to the transmitted symbols.

   ```python
   self._channel = AWGN()
   ```

6. **Develop the Baseline class:**
   Using the TensorFlow Keras API, define a custom class `Baseline(Model)` that will act as the communication system model. Make sure to add an `__init__` method to initialize all the layers and use the `call` method to describe the steps for passing input through the system:

   ```python
   class Baseline(Model):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           # Initialize BinarySource, LDPC Encoder/Decoder, Mapper, Channel, and Demapper
           # The code block for baseline class initialization goes here
       
       @tf.function(jit_compile=True)
       def call(self, batch_size, ebno_db):
           # Generate binary data
           # Encode the binary data
           # Map encoded data to constellation symbols
           # Pass the symbols through the AWGN channel
           # Demap received symbols back to binary data
           # Decode the binary data
           # Return original and decoded data
           # The code block for the Baseline class call goes here
   ```

   In the provided context, you can see how the Baseline class is implemented, and you should follow that structure, particularly the method `call`, as it outlines the complete pipeline for processing the signal through the communication system.

7. **Instantiate and evaluate the Baseline model:**
   Create an instance of the Baseline model, choose a batch size and a range of $E_b/N_0$ (in dB) values to evaluate, and use the `sim_ber` function to simulate and calculate the Bit Error Rate (BER)/Block Error Rate (BLER) over an AWGN channel.

   ```python
   model_baseline = Baseline()
   _, bler = sim_ber(model_baseline, ebno_dbs, batch_size=128, num_target_block_errors=1000, max_mc_iter=1000)
   ```

   This function will require the definition of `ebno_dbs` (SNR range), and you may need to adapt it to match the specific arguments required for the `sim_ber()` function.

8. **Visualize the results:**
   After running the simulations, you can plot the BLER against $E_b/N_0$ to visualize the performance of the Baseline model.

By following these steps, you can implement a model of a QAM-based communication system over an AWGN channel using Gray labeling and conventional demapping in Sionna.

INSTRUCTION: Guide on how to test the BER/BLER performance of the defined `Baseline` model across a given range of E_b/N_0 (SNR) values using the `sim_ber` function from Sionna.
ANSWER:To test the Bit Error Rate (BER) / Block Error Rate (BLER) performance of the `Baseline` model across a range of \( E_b/N_0 \) (SNR) values using Sionna's `sim_ber` function, you can follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Environment:**
   Ensure that Sionna and other necessary packages are installed and imported. Also, make sure you have a GPU configured and available if you're planning to run simulations that require high computational power.

2. **Define the SNR Range:**
   Decide on the range of \( E_b/N_0 \) values over which you want to test your `Baseline` model. For example:

   ```python
   ebno_db_min = ... # Set your minimum SNR value
   ebno_db_max = ... # Set your maximum SNR value
   step = 0.5  # Set your step size
   
   ebno_dbs = np.arange(ebno_db_min, ebno_db_max, step)
   ```

   Replace `...` with your desired values for minimum and maximum SNR in decibels.

3. **Instantiate the Baseline Model:**
   Create an instance of the `Baseline` model as described in your code context. It looks something like this:

   ```python
   model_baseline = Baseline()
   ```

4. **Load Pre-trained Weights:**
   If your model requires pre-trained weights, load them using a utility function provided or defined in your context (correct this to match your actual function and file paths if necessary):

   ```python
   model_weights_path = 'path_to_your_model_weights.pkl' # Update this path as needed.
   load_weights(model_baseline, model_weights_path)
   ```

5. **Simulate BER/BLER Performance:**
   Use the `sim_ber` function to simulate the performance of the `Baseline` model. You will need to provide the model instance, the range of SNR values, batch size, the number of target block errors, and maximum Monte Carlo iterations.
   
   ```python
   batch_size = 128  # Or another appropriate size for your simulations.
   num_target_block_errors = 1000  # The number of target block errors for stopping the simulation.
   max_mc_iter = 1000  # The maximum number of Monte Carlo iterations.

   _, bler = sim_ber(model_baseline, ebno_dbs, batch_size=batch_size,
                     num_target_block_errors=num_target_block_errors, max_mc_iter=max_mc_iter)
   ```

6. **Analyze Results:**
   The `bler` tensor obtained from the `sim_ber` function contains the BLER results for each tested SNR value. You can convert this to numpy and plot it, or analyze it as necessary:

   ```python
   bler_results = bler.numpy()
   plt.semilogy(ebno_dbs, bler_results, 'o-')
   plt.xlabel(r"$E_b/N_0$ (dB)")
   plt.ylabel("BLER")
   plt.grid(which="both")
   plt.title("BLER Performance of Baseline Model")
   plt.show()
   ```

Remember to adjust your simulation parameters such as `batch_size`, `num_target_block_errors`, and `max_mc_iter` according to your requirements and available computational resources.

INSTRUCTION: Describe how to implement a utility function to load pretrained weights into a Sionna model and apply it to instances of newly defined `Baseline` models.
ANSWER:To implement a utility function that loads pretrained weights into a Sionna model and then applies it to instances of newly defined `Baseline` models, you can follow the pattern established in the provided context. The included utility function `load_weights` is already designed for this task, setting the weights of a model using the pickle module.

Here is the process decomposed into steps, leveraging the information provided:

1. **Define the Utility Function:**
   The utility function `load_weights` takes a Sionna model and the path to the pretrained model weights stored in a file. It then loads these weights into the given model.

   ```python
   # Utility function to load and set weights of a model
   def load_weights(model, model_weights_path):
       model(1, tf.constant(10.0, tf.float32))  # Dummy forward pass to build the model
       with open(model_weights_path, 'rb') as f:
           weights = pickle.load(f)
       model.set_weights(weights)
   ```

2. **Create an Instance of the `Baseline` Model:**
   Before loading the weights, create an instance of the `Baseline` model. Since Sionna often builds the model dynamically based on the first call to it, you should do a dummy forward pass if you're unsure whether the model has been built.

   ```python
   model_baseline = Baseline()
   ```

3. **Perform a Dummy Forward Pass if Needed:**
    Some layers might require a forward pass to build their weights if the model has not been used yet. `load_weights` function in the context ensures this by performing a dummy forward pass with a batch size of 1 and an arbitrary signal-to-noise ratio.

4. **Load Pretrained Weights:**
   Use the `load_weights` function by providing the newly created `Baseline` model instance and the path to the pretrained weights file.

   ```python
   model_weights_path = 'path/to/pretrained/weights.pkl'  # Path to the saved weights
   load_weights(model_baseline, model_weights_path)
   ```

5. **Apply the Model:**
   After the weights have been loaded, you can apply the `Baseline` model to perform whatever tasks it is designed for, such as predictions, evaluations, or further training.

The functions and model definitions that you would typically find in the context are assumed to be similar, particularly for the `Baseline` model class and the `load_weights` utility function. By following this procedure, pretrained weights can be applied to instances of the `Baseline` models.

You can then use the trained models to simulate performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER) or Block Error Rate (BLER) under different conditions, or visualize the learned constellations if applicable to the model type. To perform a full evaluation of the `Baseline` model, as seen in the context, you would run simulation experiments over a range of Eb/N0 (SNR) values, collect performance metrics, and produce plots to visualize the performance.

INSTRUCTION: Explain how to compare the BLER results from multiple communication system models, including a baseline and an autoencoder trained with different methods, and display the outcomes in a graphical format.
ANSWER:To compare the Block Error Rate (BLER) results from multiple communication system models, including a baseline and an autoencoder trained with different methods, and display the outcomes graphically, you can follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Run your communication system simulations across a range of $E_b/N_0$ (energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) values to gather BLER statistics for each system. In the provided context, simulations are conducted for a baseline system using Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) with Gray labeling, and two autoencoder models trained with conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based technique.

2. **Collect Results**: Store the BLER results in a data structure, such as a dictionary, for easy access. This has been illustrated in the given context where the BLERs for different models at various $E_b/N_0$ points are kept within a `BLER` dictionary:
    ```python
    BLER = {}
    BLER['baseline'] = bler_baseline.numpy()
    BLER['autoencoder-conv'] = bler_conv.numpy()
    BLER['autoencoder-rl'] = bler_rl.numpy()
    ```

3. **Graphical Visualization**: To visualize the comparisons, plot the BLER results on a graph, with $E_b/N_0$ on the x-axis and BLER on the y-axis. Since BLER values typically span several orders of magnitude, a semilogarithmic plot is ideal. Here is how you could create such a plot using `matplotlib`:

    ```python
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
    plt.semilogy(ebno_dbs, BLER['baseline'], 'o-', color='C0', label='Baseline')
    plt.semilogy(ebno_dbs, BLER['autoencoder-conv'], 'x-.', color='C1', label='Autoencoder - conventional training')
    plt.semilogy(ebno_dbs, BLER['autoencoder-rl'], 's--', color='C2', label='Autoencoder - RL-based training')
    plt.xlabel(r"$E_b/N_0$ (dB)")
    plt.ylabel("BLER")
    plt.grid(which="both")
    plt.legend(loc='upper right')
    plt.title("BLER Comparison")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    ```
    This code generates a plot with different markers and line styles for each communication system to distinguish between them. The `semilogy` function is used to create a plot with a log-scale on the y-axis for BLER.

4. **Analysis**: Interpret the plot to analyze the performance of the different models. Typically, you'll be looking for which system has the lowest BLER at each $E_b/N_0$ value, indicating the most robust performance under the given simulation conditions.

5. **Save/Share Results**: Lastly, save the plot as an image or a file for documentation or presentation purposes. If necessary, you can also serialize the underlying BLER data with a format like JSON or using Python's `pickle` module, as seen in the context for future analysis or reproduction of the results.

Remember, when comparing results, ensure that each system has been simulated under similar conditions (e.g., same batch sizes, channel models, and number of errors or blocks) to warrant a fair comparison.

INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate how to visualize the learned constellations of an autoencoder-based communication system's transmitter, and explain how these constellations can provide insights into the system's performance.
ANSWER:To visualize the learned constellations of an autoencoder-based communication system, you can access the autoencoder's transmitter side, where the constellations are defined. Specifically, these constellations are a result of the autoencoder learning to map bit sequences to signal points in a way that is resilient to noise and other channel impairments.

The learned constellations can provide insights into how the autoencoder has adapted to the communication channel conditions, including noise and interference. By analyzing the constellation diagram, you can better understand the effectiveness of the symbol mapping and thus infer aspects of the system's performance. For instance, if the learned constellation points are well-separated, it indicates a lower likelihood of symbol confusion and typically leads to a lower bit error rate (BER). On the other hand, points that are closer together or not well-distributed may suggest higher error rates and potential areas for improvement.

To visualize and compare the learned constellations for both conventional and reinforcement learning (RL)-based training approaches, you may use the following code snippets provided in the context:

1. For the model trained with conventional training:
```python
model_conventional = E2ESystemConventionalTraining(training=True)
load_weights(model_conventional, model_weights_path_conventional_training)
fig = model_conventional.constellation.show()
fig.suptitle('Conventional training');
```

2. For the model trained with RL-based training:
```python
model_rl = E2ESystemRLTraining(training=False)
load_weights(model_rl, model_weights_path_rl_training)
fig = model_rl.constellation.show()
fig.suptitle('RL-based training');
```

In these code snippets:
- The `E2ESystemConventionalTraining` and `E2ESystemRLTraining` are the classes that represent the autoencoder models for each of the training paradigms.
- The `load_weights` function is used to load the previously saved model weights for each trained model.
- The `constellation.show()` method generates the constellation diagram, a scatter plot of the constellation points.
- `fig.suptitle()` is used to title the figure to indicate the type of training that was used to obtain the constellation.

Analyzing these diagrams allows you to see the geometry of the signal space that the autoencoder has learned. The goal is usually to have the constellation points spread out as much as possible to minimize the risk of errors due to noise. Visual examination of how points are clustered can offer insights into how the autoencoder's transmitter is performing and whether certain points may be more prone to errors than others.

These visualizations are highly informative for researchers and engineers working on designing communication systems, as they provide a tangible means to assess and compare the system's resilience to channel imperfections.

INSTRUCTION: Close with the importance of referring to cited references within the Sionna documentation to understand the foundational concepts related to the end-to-end learning with autoencoders.
ANSWER:Understanding the foundational concepts related to end-to-end learning with autoencoders is crucial for anyone working with or interpreting the results from the Sionna documentation. These concepts provide the theoretical background needed to comprehend how an end-to-end communication system is modelled as an autoencoder, as well as the nuances involved in its training and evaluation.

Referring to the cited references within the Sionna documentation offers a deeper insight into the methodologies, assumptions, and innovations that shape the design of autoencoders for communication systems. For instance, the initial reference [1] introduces deep learning for the physical layer, which is a cornerstone for conceptualizing communication systems as learnable models. Further, the approach to joint training of constellation geometry and bit-labeling hinges on the understanding provided in [2], which outlines how trainable communication systems can be established.

Moreover, when alternative training algorithms are used, such as the model-free reinforcement learning-based training detailed in [3], referring to the original source material ensures clarity about the implementation diverging from requiring a differentiable channel model. These references are pivotal in grasping the trade-offs and choices made during the development of the models presented in the Sionna documentation.

As such, meticulously examining the cited literature enables users and researchers to appreciate the underlying principles of end-to-end learning with autoencoders. It assures a comprehensive grasp of the complexity and sophistication behind the Sionna implementations, therefore facilitating a more informed use and interpretation of the systems modeled therein.
