INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate how to set up an appropriate environment to run Sionna with a specified GPU and memory settings using TensorFlow.
ANSWER:To set up an appropriate environment to run Sionna on a specific GPU with controlled memory settings using TensorFlow, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Select the GPU you wish to use**: If you have multiple GPUs and want to designate a specific GPU to run your TensorFlow computations, you can set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. This variable takes a zero-based index of the GPUs you want to use. For example, to use the first GPU (GPU 0), set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to `"0"`.

2. **Control GPU memory usage**: TensorFlow by default allocates the entire memory of all visible GPUs when a TensorFlow session is created. To allocate only as much memory as is needed (which can reduce fragmentation and allow for running multiple TensorFlow programs on the same GPU), you can enable the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` option for the GPU you are using.

Based on the context provided, here's how to set up Sionna with specified GPU and memory settings using TensorFlow:

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Specify the GPU number you wish to use (Zero-based indexing)
gpu_num = 0 # For example, to use the first GPU

# Set the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_num)

# Set the logging level to avoid unnecessary TensorFlow warnings
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3' # 0: default, 1: no INFO, 2: no WARNING, 3: no ERROR

# Try importing Sionna, and install if necessary
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError as e:
    # Install Sionna if the package is not already installed
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna

# Only allow as much GPU memory usage as is needed by the runtime
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Assuming that we want to set memory growth for the first GPU device
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

# Set the TensorFlow logger level to ERROR to avoid warnings
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
```

This code sets up TensorFlow to use GPU 0 (`gpu_num = 0`) and enables memory growth on that GPU, which allows TensorFlow to incrementally allocate memory as needed rather than grabbing all available GPU memory at program start.

Note that the variable `gpus` retrieved by `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` is a list of all available GPUs as reported by TensorFlow. By indexing this list, you're selecting which GPU you will apply memory growth settings to. Remember that the GPU devices are mapped according to the ordering of `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, so `gpus[0]` will always refer to the first GPU listed in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

Additionally, setting the log level to 'ERROR' will suppress most of the warnings and information messages during code execution, making it easier to see errors that require attention. 

If at any point the number of available GPUs changes, or if you wish to use a different GPU, you must update the `gpu_num` variable and potentially restart your runtime so that the CUDA device can be reinitialized.

INSTRUCTION: Install the Sionna package if it is not already installed, and display how to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output.
ANSWER:To install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:

```python
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError as e:
    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed
    import os
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna
```

This snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.

In order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:

```python
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
```

Setting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.

Additionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
```

This line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.

INSTRUCTION: Illustrate the process of importing necessary modules and components from Sionna and other Python libraries for constructing an OFDM SIMO system model.
ANSWER:To construct an OFDM SIMO (Single Input, Multiple Output) system model using Sionna and other Python libraries, follow these general steps along with the corresponding code imports:

1. **GPU Configuration**: Import TensorFlow and configure it to manage GPU usage and memory growth to avoid consuming the GPU memory all at once.

2. **Sionna and Python Libraries Imports**: Import Sionna, which is a library for simulating communication systems, as well as other necessary Python libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations, TensorFlow for machine learning functionalities, and Matplotlib for plotting.

3. **Sionna Classes for OFDM SIMO**: Import specific classes from Sionna library that are needed for building the OFDM SIMO system model. These include channel models, OFDM components, MIMO techniques, mapping and demapping functions, FEC (Forward Error Correction) codes, and utilities for bit error rate (BER) calculations.

Now, taking into account the information from the context, here's how you can go about importing the necessary modules and components:

```python
# Import TensorFlow and configure GPU settings
import tensorflow as tf
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')

# Import Sionna for simulating communication systems
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError as e:
    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed
    import os
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna

# Import commonly used libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import classes from Sionna for building OFDM SIMO system
from sionna.channel.tr38901 import Antenna, AntennaArray, CDL
from sionna.channel import OFDMChannel
from sionna.mimo import StreamManagement
from sionna.ofdm import (ResourceGrid, ResourceGridMapper, LSChannelEstimator,
                         LMMSEEqualizer, RemoveNulledSubcarriers,
                         ResourceGridDemapper)
from sionna.utils import (BinarySource, ebnodb2no, insert_dims,
                          flatten_last_dims, log10, expand_to_rank)
from sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding import LDPC5GEncoder
from sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPC5GDecoder
from sionna.mapping import Mapper, Demapper
from sionna.utils.metrics import compute_ber
from sionna.utils import sim_ber

# [Optional: Add any additional classes or functions that might be needed 
# specifically for constructing the neural receiver part of the OFDM SIMO system model.]
```

In this code, we:

- Set up TensorFlow to manage GPU configuration, suppress excessive log messages, and prevent it from consuming all GPU memory upfront.
- Check if Sionna is installed and if it's not, install it.
- Import the main Python libraries that are required for numerical operations and plotting.
- Import the necessary classes from the Sionna library for creating the different parts of the OFDM SIMO communication link, including the transmitter, channel, and receiver components.
  
Please note that additional classes or functions can be imported based on further requirements, such as the specific neural receiver used in the OFDM SIMO system model. The context provided suggests that there might be a custom neural receiver (`NeuralReceiver`), which would also need to be imported or defined if it's not part of the Sionna library. 

Remember to adjust and add imports as necessary to match the specific components used in the system you're designing.

INSTRUCTION: Explain the procedure of creating a Keras model class named E2ESystem, highlighting the use of the 'system' and 'training' parameters to toggle between training and evaluation modes.
ANSWER:To create a Keras model class named `E2ESystem`, which is capable of switching between training and evaluation modes using the 'system' and 'training' parameters, you would follow the provided guidelines and explanations. Hereâ€™s a procedural breakdown with highlights on the use of these parameters:

1. **Class Definition**:
   Begin by defining the class `E2ESystem` that inherits from `tensorflow.keras.Model`.

```python
class E2ESystem(Model):
    # Your class implementation will go here
```

2. **Constructor**:
   Implement the constructor method `__init__(self, system, training=False)`. The 'system' parameter is used to specify the system setup, while the 'training' parameter indicates if the model is in training or evaluation mode. During instantiation, these parameters are stored as class attributes.

```python
def __init__(self, system, training=False):
    super().__init__()
    self._system = system
    self._training = training
    # Additional initialization will go here
```

3. **Transmitter**:
   In this step, the transmitter components are defined, which includes a binary source. During training, components such as outer encoder and decoder might not be necessary; hence, they are only instantiated based on the 'training' flag.

4. **Channel**:
   Set up the channel model, which would be common to all systems implemented in the `E2ESystem` class.

5. **Receiver**:
   Depending on the value of 'system', initialize different receiver components. For instance, if the 'system' is set to "baseline-perfect-csi", instantiate the perfect CSI knowledge components. Similarly, for "baseline-ls-estimation", set up with least squares (LS) components. If 'system' is "neural-receiver", instantiate the neural receiver-specific components.

6. **Call Method**:
   Define the `call(self, batch_size, ebno_db)` method. This is where you implement the logic that uses the 'system' and 'training' parameters to dictate the model behavior. In the case of 'training' being `True`, you would compute and return the Bit-Metric Decoding (BMD) rate as it's relevant for training the neural receiver. Otherwise, return the bits for BER/BLER computation if 'training' is `False`.

```python
@tf.function
def call(self, batch_size, ebno_db):
    # Implement the logic using the 'system' and 'training' attributes
```

7. **Training/Evaluation Toggling**:
   In the `call` method, use the `self._training` flag to differentiate between training and evaluation flows. For example, if `self._training` is `True`, after receiving the LLRs from the receiver, compute the loss for training. If `self._training` is `False`, use the LLRs to decode bits and compute performance metrics like BER/BLER.

By designing the `E2ESystem` class with the 'system' and 'training' attributes, you effectively create a flexible model that can switch its behavior based on its intended use case. During instantiation, you can specify the mode and system type the model should operate in, and the `call` method ensures that the model behaves accordingly during execution.

INSTRUCTION: Show how to define the transmitter components within the E2ESystem class while accounting for reduced complexity when in training mode.
ANSWER:To define the transmitter components within the `E2ESystem` class with reduced complexity when in training mode, you can take advantage of the conditional logic that checks the `training` flag. When the system is in training mode, you avoid instantiating certain components, especially those that are computationally expensive and are not needed during training, such as the outer encoder and decoder.

Here's how you might set it up in the class definition:

```python
class E2ESystem(Model):
    def __init__(self, system, training=False):
        super().__init__()
        
        self._system = system
        self._training = training

        ######################################
        ## Transmitter
        # Instantiate necessary transmitter components here
        self._binary_source = BinarySource()
        self._mapper = Mapper("qam", num_bits_per_symbol)
        self._rg_mapper = ResourceGridMapper(resource_grid)

        # In training mode, do not include the outer encoder, as it's not needed 
        if not training:
            self._encoder = LDPC5GEncoder(k, n)

        # Other transmitter components and configurations can be added here.
        # ...

    # Other parts of the E2ESystem class definition
    # ...
```

In the above snippet, we see that if the `training` flag is `False`, which means the system is not in training mode, an instance of `LDPC5GEncoder` is created and assigned to `self._encoder`. In contrast, if `training` is `True`, this encoder is not instantiatedâ€”reducing the complexity of the setup needed for training.

It's good practice to ensure that any components not directly necessary for the training process are not instantiated or used during training. This helps to reduce memory usage and computational demands, allowing for faster and more efficient training of neural networks or other machine learning models embedded within such a system.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the process of defining a 3GPP CDL channel within the E2ESystem class and how to apply it to form channel inputs.
ANSWER:To define a 3GPP CDL channel within the `E2ESystem` class in the given context, you would follow these steps within the class definition:

1. **Instantiate a 3GPP CDL Channel Model:**
   You specify the parameters for the CDL (Clustered Delay Line) channel model, such as the CDL model type (A, B, C, etc.), delay spread, carrier frequency, antenna arrays for user terminal (UT) and base station (BS), and the speed of the UT. In the provided code snippet, a CDL channel instance is created as follows:

   ```python
   cdl = CDL(cdl_model, delay_spread, carrier_frequency,
             ut_antenna, bs_array, "uplink", min_speed=speed)
   ```

2. **Create an OFDM Channel Instance with the CDL Model:**
   This instance is then used to create an `OFDMChannel`, which simulates how the signal gets distorted when passing through the defined 3GPP CDL channel. The `OFDMChannel` factor in the characteristics defined by the `CDL` instance and applies them to the transmitted `ResourceGrid`. The code in the context includes this instantiation:

   ```python
   self._channel = OFDMChannel(cdl, resource_grid, normalize_channel=True, return_channel=True)
   ```

3. **Generate Channel Inputs:**
   To generate the channel inputs, a series of steps involving encoding, modulation, and mapping onto a resource grid are performed. The code below shows how this can be done within the `call` method of the `E2ESystem` class:

   ```python
   # Generate a batch of binary sequences
   if self._training:
       c = self._binary_source([batch_size, 1, 1, n])
   else:
       b = self._binary_source([batch_size, 1, 1, k])
       c = self._encoder(b)  # LDPC encoding (if not in training mode)
   
   # Modulate the binary sequences
   x = self._mapper(c)
   
   # Map the modulated symbols onto the resource grid
   x_rg = self._rg_mapper(x)
   ```

4. **Apply the CDL Channel to Channel Inputs:**
   With channel inputs ready, you now apply the channel by calling the instance of `OFDMChannel` with these inputs and noise variance to get the distorted received samples `y` along with the channel state information `h`:

   ```python
   # Adjust the noise variance tensor's shape to match that of the inputs
   no_ = expand_to_rank(no, tf.rank(x_rg))
   
   # Sample and apply the channel
   y, h = self._channel([x_rg, no_])
   ```

5. **Process at the Receiver:**
   At the receiver side, you decide which type of receiver to use based on the `system` parameter. If perfect CSI is assumed, no channel estimation error is considered. Otherwise, least squares (LS) channel estimation is performed.

When defining the `E2ESystem` class and the `call` method within it, ensure that data flow is consistent with operations such as encoding, modulation, channel application, and reception, all happening in sequence as per the input-output relationship designed in the class.

The provided code illustrates an example end-to-end system that uses 3GPP CDL channel models with options for perfect CSI or LS channel estimation in the receiver. The instantiation and application of the channel model are embedded within the modular structure of the class, allowing for a clean separation between the stages of the communication process.

INSTRUCTION: Clarify how to set up the receiver in the E2ESystem class, detailing the three options based on the 'system' parameter: perfect CSI baseline, LS estimation baseline, and the neural receiver.
ANSWER:To set up the receiver in the `E2ESystem` class of the OFDM SIMO system, you need to specify the `system` parameter when instantiating the class. Depending on the chosen system, the receiver will be set up differently. Below are the three options based on the `system` parameter:

### 1. Perfect CSI Baseline (`'baseline-perfect-csi'`)

For the perfect channel state information (CSI) baseline, the system assumes perfect knowledge of the channel. You do not perform channel estimation in this case because the channel is presumed known perfectly at the receiver.

Here's how the receiver is set up in the class definition for perfect CSI:

```python
if system == 'baseline-perfect-csi':
    self._removed_null_subc = RemoveNulledSubcarriers(resource_grid)
    # The following components are required by both baselines
    self._lmmse_equ = LMMSEEqualizer(resource_grid, stream_manager)
    self._demapper = Demapper("app", "qam", num_bits_per_symbol)
```

### 2. LS Estimation Baseline (`'baseline-ls-estimation'`)

For the least squares (LS) estimation baseline, the receiver uses the transmitted pilots to perform LS channel estimation, along with nearest-neighbor interpolation. LS estimation is a method of estimating the channel based on the least squares algorithm.

Here's how the LS estimation baseline is set up in the class:

```python
elif system == 'baseline-ls-estimation':
    self._ls_est = LSChannelEstimator(resource_grid, interpolation_type="nn")
    # The following components are required by both baselines
    self._lmmse_equ = LMMSEEqualizer(resource_grid, stream_manager)
    self._demapper = Demapper("app", "qam", num_bits_per_symbol)
```

### 3. Neural Receiver (`'neural-receiver'`)

For the neural receiver system, a neural network is used to substitute the traditional functions of channel estimation, equalization, and demapping. This neural receiver directly computes log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received signal.

Here's how the neural receiver is set up in the class:

```python
elif system == "neural-receiver":
    self._neural_receiver = NeuralReceiver()
    self._rg_demapper = ResourceGridDemapper(resource_grid, stream_manager)  # Used to extract data-carrying resource elements
```

Depending on whether the `training` parameter is `True` or `False`, the system also handles the LDPC outer encoder and decoder differently. If the system is being trained (`training=True`), these components are not instantiated to reduce computational complexity since training does not require outer encoding and decoding.

When you run the `call` method of the `E2ESystem` model with the specified `system` parameter, the appropriate receiver (either a baseline with perfect CSI knowledge, a baseline with LS estimation, or the neural receiver) is executed based on your specification to compute the LLRs on the coded bits. If `training` is set to `False`, the outer decoder reconstructs the information bits, and if `training` is set to `True`, the bit-metric decoding (BMD) rate is estimated over the batch.

INSTRUCTION: Construct a method within the E2ESystem class to simulate a batch of transmissions through the specified end-to-end system, including the necessary steps for computing LLRs and BMD rates during training.
ANSWER:Based on the given context:

```python
class E2ESystem(Model):
    # ...
```

We can construct a method within the `E2ESystem` class to simulate a batch of transmissions through the specified end-to-end system, compute log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), and estimate bit-metric decoding (BMD) rates during training as follows:

```python
class E2ESystem(Model):
    # existing class code ...

    def simulate_batch_transmissions(self, batch_size, snr_db):
        # Convert SNR from dB to linear scale noise variance for each batch example
        noise_variance = ebnodb2no(snr_db, self._num_bits_per_symbol, self._coderate)
        noise_variance = expand_to_rank(noise_variance, 4)  # noise_variance tensor shape adjustment if needed

        # Step 1: Generate a batch of random binary sequences of shape [batch_size, num_bits]
        random_binary_sequences = self._binary_source([batch_size, 1, 1, self._n])

        # Step 2: Map the binary sequences onto symbols using the mapper
        modulated_symbols = self._mapper(random_binary_sequences)

        # Step 3: Create resource grids from the mapped symbols
        resource_grids = self._rg_mapper(modulated_symbols)

        # Step 4: Sample a batch of channel realizations and apply the channel
        received_symbols, channel_response = self._channel([resource_grids, noise_variance])

        # Step 5: Execute the receiver on the post-DFT received samples to compute LLRs
        if "baseline" in self._system:
            if self._system == 'baseline-perfect-csi':
                channel_estimate = self._removed_null_subc(channel_response)  # Perfect CSI
                channel_estimate_error = tf.zeros_like(noise_variance)
            elif self._system == 'baseline-ls-estimation':
                channel_estimate, channel_estimate_error = self._ls_est([received_symbols, noise_variance])  # LS estimation
            
            equalized_symbols, effective_noise_variance = self._lmmse_equ(
                [received_symbols, channel_estimate, channel_estimate_error, noise_variance]
            )
            llrs = self._demapper([equalized_symbols, effective_noise_variance])
        elif self._system == "neural-receiver":
            llrs = self._neural_receiver([tf.squeeze(received_symbols, axis=1), noise_variance])

        # Step 6: If training, estimate the BMD rate
        if self._training:
            cross_entropy = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
                labels=random_binary_sequences, logits=llrs
            )
            average_cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy)
            bmd_rate = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32) - average_cross_entropy / tf.math.log(2.0)
            return bmd_rate
        else:
            # During evaluation, compute the BER or BLER here as needed
            pass
            # Add any additional steps as required to complete the simulation

# Code continues...
```

This method follows the structure given in the context with added comments to explain each step. It assumes the existence of certain instance attributes and methods such as `_binary_source`, `_mapper`, `_rg_mapper`, `_channel`, etc., as indicated in the provided code. Also, please note that this method would be added within the existing `E2ESystem` class and would leverage the available properties and methods. The method `simulate_batch_transmissions` will run the simulation for a given batch size and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), returning the BMD rate during training or conducting other evaluations when not training. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific values of `batch_size`, `snr_db`, the actual system model (`_system`), and whether or not the model is in training mode (`_training`).

INSTRUCTION: Showcase the proper way to initialize and run the E2ESystem model for evaluating baseline systems (perfect CSI and LS estimation) over a range of SNRs, including how to collect and store the results.
ANSWER:To properly initialize and run the `E2ESystem` model for evaluating baseline systems over a range of SNRs, and to collect and store the results, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Model:**
   The `E2ESystem` class takes two important parameters â€” `system` specifies which system to use (either `'baseline-perfect-csi'` or `'baseline-ls-estimation'`), and `training` specifies whether this is a training run (`True`) or an evaluation run (`False`). For the evaluation of the baseline systems, `training` should be set to `False`.

   ```python
   perfect_csi_model = E2ESystem(system='baseline-perfect-csi', training=False)
   ls_estimation_model = E2ESystem(system='baseline-ls-estimation', training=False)
   ```
   
2. **Define the SNR Range:**
   Select the range of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) in dB for which you'd like to evaluate the baseline systems.

   ```python
   ebno_dbs = np.arange(ebno_db_min, ebno_db_max, step)  # Replace with actual values for min, max, and step
   ```

3. **Run the Simulation:**
   Using `sim_ber` function, you can simulate Bit Error Rate (BER) or Block Error Rate (BLER) for the given range of SNRs. Provide the model initialized in step 1, the SNR range from step 2, and additional parameters such as `batch_size`, `num_target_block_errors`, and `max_mc_iter`.

   ```python
   # Dictionnary storing the evaluation results
   BLER = {}

   # For Perfect CSI
   _, bler_perfect_csi = sim_ber(perfect_csi_model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=128, num_target_block_errors=100, max_mc_iter=100)
   BLER['baseline-perfect-csi'] = bler_perfect_csi.numpy()

   # For LS Estimation
   _, bler_ls_estimation = sim_ber(ls_estimation_model, ebno_dbs, batch_size=128, num_target_block_errors=100, max_mc_iter=100)
   BLER['baseline-ls-estimation'] = bler_ls_estimation.numpy()
   ```
   
4. **Store the Results:**
   The results are collected and stored in the `BLER` dictionary. The code above already stores the BLER values for both perfect CSI and LS estimation systems in `BLER`. For persistent storage, you may want to write the results to a file. Here's how you could pickle the BLER results:

   ```python
   with open('BLER_results.pickle', 'wb') as handle:
       pickle.dump(BLER, handle, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
   ```

5. **Plotting (Optional):**
   If you want to visualize the BLER results over the SNR range, you can use the following code snippet:

   ```python
   plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
   plt.semilogy(ebno_dbs, BLER['baseline-perfect-csi'], label='Perfect CSI')
   plt.semilogy(ebno_dbs, BLER['baseline-ls-estimation'], label='LS Estimation')
   plt.xlabel('Eb/No [dB]')
   plt.ylabel('BLER')
   plt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

When executing the above instructions, make sure that you replace placeholders (`ebno_db_min`, `ebno_db_max`, `step`) with actual numerical values provided in your simulation's context or as per your requirements. These steps collectively represent the setup, execution, and result storage process for evaluating baseline systems using the `E2ESystem` model.

INSTRUCTION: Explain how to visualize the block error rate (BLER) results using matplotlib, including reference lines for the pre-computed BLER values.
ANSWER:To visualize the Block Error Rate (BLER) results using matplotlib and include reference lines for the pre-computed BLER values, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

2. Collect the BLER data:
You need to have the BLER results at different SNR (signal to noise ratio) values, stored in a dictionary or any similar data structure. For this example, let's assume you have a dictionary named `BLER` where the keys are the SNR values in dB and values are the corresponding BLER measurements. Additionally, you may have pre-computed BLER values that you want to refer to, stored in a dictionary named `precomputed_BLER`.

3. Create a plot:
Use matplotlib to plot the BLER against the SNR values:

```python
# SNR values and corresponding BLER results
snr_values = np.array(list(BLER.keys()))
bler_results = np.array(list(BLER.values()))

# Plot the BLER results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(snr_values, bler_results, '-o', label="Measured BLER")

# If you have pre-computed BLER values, plot them as well
precomputed_snr_values = np.array(list(precomputed_BLER.keys()))
precomputed_bler_results = np.array(list(precomputed_BLER.values()))
plt.plot(precomputed_snr_values, precomputed_bler_results, '--', label="Pre-computed BLER")

# Adding labels, title, legend, and grid
plt.xlabel('Eb/No (dB)')
plt.ylabel('BLER')
plt.title('Block Error Rate (BLER) vs SNR')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

# Optionally set log scale for y-axis if BLER varies several orders of magnitude
plt.yscale('log')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

The above code will generate a line plot where the x-axis represents the SNR values in dB, and the y-axis represents the BLER. The `'-o'` in the `plot()` function specifies that the measured BLER values should be connected with a line and marked with circles. A dashed line `'--'` is used to indicate the pre-computed BLER results. We enable the grid by setting `plt.grid(True)`, and using `plt.yscale('log')` will set the y-axis to a logarithmic scale, which is common for BLER plots as it tends to span many orders of magnitude.

Ensure that you replace the `BLER` and `precomputed_BLER` variables with the actual data structures containing your BLER information. If you have run simulations or have actual measurement results, you would have your BLER results ready for visualization using the above template.

INSTRUCTION: Discuss the significance of the final block of the evaluation simulation output and how to interpret the stopping conditions based on the occurrence of errors at different EbNo levels.
ANSWER:The final block of the evaluation simulation output provides a summary of the performance metrics for each evaluated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) point, expressed in terms of Eb/No (energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) levels, and the outcomes of the evaluation runs. An example output table looks like this:

```
EbNo [dB] |        BER |       BLER |  bit errors |    num bits | block errors |  num blocks | runtime [s] |    status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     -5.0 | 2.5345e-01 | 1.0000e+00 |       45158 |      178176 |          128 |         128 |         7.3 |reached target block errors
     ...
      2.0 | 0.0000e+00 | 0.0000e+00 |           0 |    17817600 |            0 |       12800 |        10.9 |reached max iter
```

This output includes several important metrics and stopping conditions:

1. **EbNo [dB]:** The energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio, expressed in decibels for each measurement point.

2. **BER (Bit Error Rate):** The ratio of the number of bit errors to the total number of bits transmitted.

3. **BLER (Block Error Rate):** The ratio of the number of blocks with at least one bit error to the total number of blocks transmitted.

4. **bit errors:** The total number of bit errors that occurred during the simulation at a given EbNo level.

5. **num bits:** The total number of bits that were transmitted at a given EbNo level.

6. **block errors:** The total number of blocks with at least one error at a given EbNo level.

7. **num blocks:** The total number of blocks that were transmitted at a given EbNo level.

8. **runtime [s]:** The simulation time in seconds for each EbNo value.

9. **status:** This indicates whether the simulation run stopped because it reached the maximum number of Monte Carlo iterations (`reached max iter`) or it reached the target number of block errors (`reached target block errors`).

Interpreting the stopping conditions based on the occurrence of errors at different EbNo levels provides insight into the robustness of the system under evaluation:

- **Reached target block errors:** If the simulation stops upon reaching a pre-defined number of block errors for a particular EbNo point, this indicates that enough errors have occurred to accurately estimate BLER at that EbNo level. A high BLER at this point suggests that the system's performance is inadequate at this level of noise.

- **Reached max iter:** Conversely, if the simulation run stops because it reached the maximum number of allowed Monte Carlo iterations without hitting the target number of block errors, this usually indicates that at this EbNo level, the system performs well with a low error rate. Not having enough errors to calculate the metrics reliably usually means the system can handle the channel conditions very effectively at this SNR point.

These performance metrics and stopping conditions can be used to assess the quality and reliability of a communications system over a range of signal qualities. As seen from the code snippet provided from the context, the simulation setup involves parameters like `batch_size`, `ebno_dbs` range, and stopping criteria such as `num_target_block_errors` and `max_mc_iter` to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different receiver configurations (baseline-perfect CSI, baseline-LS estimation, and neural receiver in this case) under varying channel conditions.
