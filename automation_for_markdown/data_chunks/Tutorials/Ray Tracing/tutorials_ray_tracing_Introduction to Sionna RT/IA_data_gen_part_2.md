INSTRUCTION: Set up the GPU and Python environment for working with the Sionna RT package, including library imports and GPU configuration.
ANSWER:To set up the GPU and Python environment for working with the Sionna RT package, you need to perform several steps. This includes configuring the GPU settings, installing necessary libraries (including Sionna if not already installed), importing the required modules, and setting the random seed for reproducibility.

Here is the step-by-step guide with the required code snippets:

1. **Configure GPU settings**:

First, you need to set the environment variable to specify which GPU to use. By setting `gpu_num = 0`, you are indicating to use the first GPU. If you want to use CPU instead, you can leave it as an empty string `""`. You should also set TensorFlow to be less verbose to reduce log noise.

```python
import os
gpu_num = 0  # Use "0" to use the first GPU, or leave as an empty string "" for CPU
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = f"{gpu_num}"
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # Set logging level
```

2. **Install and Import Sionna**:

Ensure that Sionna is installed and import it. If it is not installed, you can install it using pip.

```python
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError:
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna
```

3. **Set up TensorFlow to use the GPU properly**:

Set up TensorFlow to use only the amount of GPU memory as needed, rather than pre-allocating the whole GPU memory.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Setting GPU memory growth to True so that it allocates only as much
        # GPU memory as needed and allows memory to grow as the program demands
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```

4. **Set the global random seed for reproducibility**:

```python
tf.random.set_seed(1)  # Set a global random seed
```

5. **Import the necessary libraries for Sionna RT**:

After setting up the environment and installing Sionna, you need to import the necessary components for ray-tracing simulations.

```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import time
# Import Sionna RT components
from sionna.rt import load_scene, Transmitter, Receiver, PlanarArray, Camera
# For link-level simulations, among other Sionna components
from sionna.channel import cir_to_ofdm_channel, subcarrier_frequencies, OFDMChannel, ApplyOFDMChannel, CIRDataset
from sionna.nr import PUSCHConfig, PUSCHTransmitter, PUSCHReceiver
from sionna.utils import compute_ber, ebnodb2no, PlotBER
from sionna.ofdm import KBestDetector, LinearDetector
from sionna.mimo import StreamManagement
```

This setup ensures your Python environment is configured and ready to use the Sionna RT package with GPU support while minimizing memory usage and potential errors. With this configuration, you can now proceed with ray-tracing simulations and other computations using Sionna's RT module.

INSTRUCTION: Import the necessary components from Sionna RT and additional libraries needed for visualization and link-level simulations.
ANSWER:To perform ray tracing simulations with the Sionna RT library, and visualize the results, you will need to import the necessary components from Sionna RT as well as additional Python libraries that provide plotting and numerical computation capabilities. Here's how to import these components and libraries:

```python
# Import necessary components for ray tracing from Sionna RT
from sionna.rt import load_scene, Transmitter, Receiver, PlanarArray, Camera

# For link-level simulations, import the following from Sionna
from sionna.channel import cir_to_ofdm_channel, OFDMChannel, ApplyOFDMChannel, CIRDataset
from sionna.ofdm import KBestDetector, LinearDetector
from sionna.nr import PUSCHConfig, PUSCHTransmitter, PUSCHReceiver
from sionna.mimo import StreamManagement
from sionna.utils import compute_ber, ebnodb2no, PlotBER

# Import additional required libraries for numerical computations and plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Import TensorFlow and additional components for GPU configuration if needed
import tensorflow as tf
```

This set of imports will give you access to the tools necessary to work with ray tracing in the Sionna RT framework and to visualize and process the results of your simulations. It includes components for setting up scenes, transmitters, and receivers, as well as utilities for channel modeling and bit error rate (BER) analysis. The imported libraries for visualization (`matplotlib`) and numerical computations (`numpy`) will help you analyze and plot the results of your simulations. TensorFlow (`tensorflow`) is used for GPU configuration and to take advantage of hardware acceleration if available.

INSTRUCTION: Define an antenna array for both transmitters and receivers using the PlanarArray class in Sionna and specify custom parameters such as number of rows and columns, spacing, patterns, and polarization.
ANSWER:To define a custom antenna array for both transmitters and receivers using the PlanarArray class in Sionna, you should assign your custom parameters such as the number of rows and columns, spacing between the elements, the pattern, and the polarization of the antennas. Here's an example of how you can do this:

For the transmitter:

```python
# Define a custom antenna array for the transmitter
scene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=<number_of_rows_tx>, 
                             num_cols=<number_of_columns_tx>, 
                             vertical_spacing=<vertical_spacing_tx>, 
                             horizontal_spacing=<horizontal_spacing_tx>, 
                             pattern=<pattern_tx>, 
                             polarization=<polarization_tx>)
```

For the receiver:

```python
# Define a custom antenna array for the receiver
scene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=<number_of_rows_rx>, 
                             num_cols=<number_of_columns_rx>, 
                             vertical_spacing=<vertical_spacing_rx>, 
                             horizontal_spacing=<horizontal_spacing_rx>, 
                             pattern=<pattern_rx>, 
                             polarization=<polarization_rx>)
```

You should replace the placeholders (`<number_of_rows_tx>`, `<number_of_columns_tx>`, `<vertical_spacing_tx>`, etc.) with the actual values that you wish to use for your antenna array configuration. Here's an example with hypothetical custom parameters:

```python
# Custom parameters for transmitter's antenna array
scene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=4,  # 4 rows of antennas
                             num_cols=8,  # 8 columns of antennas
                             vertical_spacing=0.5,  # 0.5 lambda vertical spacing
                             horizontal_spacing=0.5,  # 0.5 lambda horizontal spacing
                             pattern="isotropic",  # Assume isotropic pattern
                             polarization="V")  # Vertical polarization

# Custom parameters for receiver's antenna array
scene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=2,  # 2 rows of antennas
                             num_cols=4,  # 4 columns of antennas
                             vertical_spacing=0.7,  # 0.7 lambda vertical spacing
                             horizontal_spacing=0.7,  # 0.7 lambda horizontal spacing
                             pattern="isotropic",  # Assume isotropic pattern
                             polarization="H")  # Horizontal polarization
```

Make sure that your spacing parameters are in terms of the wavelength (lambda) of your operating frequency. The `pattern` parameter can vary and should be set according to the specific antenna pattern you're working with. Common patterns are "isotropic", "dipole", or you can also use standard patterns based on different reference documents like "tr38901".

Polarization generally is either "V" for vertical, "H" for horizontal, "slant" or "cross". In the above example, the transmitter antennas are vertically polarized, while the receiver antennas are horizontally polarized.

Remember to replace the pattern and polarization with actual values suitable for your specific application. Note that these examples use isotropic patterns for simplicity, but you can specify more complex antenna patterns if required.

INSTRUCTION: Create instances of a transmitter and receiver with unique names, positions, and orientations (yaw, pitch, and roll). Then, add the transmitter and receiver to a scene and configure the transmitter to point towards the receiver.
ANSWER:Based on the provided context, which involves using the Sionna ray tracing module intended for simulating radio propagation, you can programmatically create instances of a `Transmitter` and a `Receiver` with unique names, positions, and orientations (yaw, pitch, and roll), then add them to a scene using Sionna's API.

Here is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to do this:

```python
# Import required Sionna components
from sionna.rt import Scene, Transmitter, Receiver, PlanarArray

# Create a Scene instance
scene = Scene()

# Define antenna arrays for transmitters and receivers (assuming identical arrays for simplicity)
# Please adjust the parameters according to your specific requirements
antenna_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1, num_cols=1, vertical_spacing=0.5, horizontal_spacing=0.5)

# Assign the antenna array to the scene's transmitters and receivers
scene.tx_array = antenna_array
scene.rx_array = antenna_array

# Create a Transmitter instance with a unique name, position, and orientation
tx = Transmitter(name="transmitter1",
                 position=[10, 20, 5],
                 orientation=[45, 0, 0])  # Yaw, Pitch, Roll in degrees

# Create a Receiver instance with a unique name, position, and orientation
rx = Receiver(name="receiver1",
              position=[30, 40, 5],
              orientation=[0, 0, 0])  # Yaw, Pitch, Roll in degrees

# Add the Transmitter and Receiver instances to the scene
scene.add(tx)
scene.add(rx)

# Configure the Transmitter to point towards the Receiver using the look_at() function
tx.look_at(rx)
```

This code snippet does the following:
- Imports the necessary components from Sionna (`Scene`, `Transmitter`, `Receiver`, and `PlanarArray`).
- Creates a scene object that will hold all components of the ray tracing simulation.
- Defines a single-element PlanarArray to be used for both the transmitter and receiver.
- Creates instances of `Transmitter` and `Receiver` with specified names, positions, and orientations. In this case, the transmitter is oriented with a yaw angle of 45 degrees (which could be representing east-northeast, depending on the convention used), and the receiver has no particular orientation.
- Adds the transmitter and receiver to the scene.
- Uses the `look_at()` method belonging to the `Transmitter` class to align the transmitter to point towards the receiver, ensuring that there is a line of sight (LoS) path between them in the simulation.

Note that the actual values for `position` and `orientation` ([x, y, z] coordinates and [yaw, pitch, roll] angles) are placeholders and should be adjusted according to the specific use case and scenario being modeled. The `look_at()` function takes care of calculating the orientation of the transmitter so that it points directly at the receiver.

Lastly, ensure that you run this code within the appropriate context and runtime environment that has access to the Sionna library and where a ray tracing simulation is intended to be performed.

INSTRUCTION: Set the carrier frequency of the scene to a specific value and understand how it affects the RadioMaterials of the scene objects.
ANSWER:To set the carrier frequency of the scene in the context of using Sionna's ray tracing module, you would assign a new value to the `scene.frequency` attribute in your code. The carrier frequency is crucial for ray tracing simulations as it influences the interaction of electromagnetic waves with the materials in the environment, characterized as RadioMaterials.

Changing the carrier frequency will affect various properties of the RadioMaterials, such as conductivity, relative permittivity, and complex relative permittivity, because these material properties are generally frequency-dependent. These properties determine how radio waves propagate through media, reflect, refract, or get absorbed, and thus are critical for accurate simulation of wireless propagation paths in a given environment.

Let’s assume you need to set the frequency to 5 GHz. You would update the frequency attribute as follows:

```python
scene.frequency = 5e9 # Set carrier frequency to 5 GHz
```

As the context implies, when you update the `scene.frequency`, it implicitly updates the RadioMaterials' parameters to reflect their frequency-dependent properties at the newly set frequency. 

In the example provided in the context, you can see how the RadioMaterial properties change when the frequency is edited:

```python
# Select an example object from the scene
so = scene.get("Altes_Rathaus-itu_marble")

# Print name of assigned radio material for different frequencies
for f in [3.5e9, 2.14e9]: # Print for different frequencies
    scene.frequency = f
    print(f"\nRadioMaterial: {so.radio_material.name} @ {scene.frequency/1e9:.2f}GHz")
    print("Conductivity:", so.radio_material.conductivity.numpy())
    print("Relative permittivity:", so.radio_material.relative_permittivity.numpy())
    print("Complex relative permittivity:", so.radio_material.complex_relative_permittivity.numpy())
    print("Relative permeability:", so.radio_material.relative_permeability.numpy())
    print("Scattering coefficient:", so.radio_material.scattering_coefficient.numpy())
    print("XPD coefficient:", so.radio_material.xpd_coefficient.numpy())
```

As this example demonstrates, after setting the scene frequency, you can access properties of the RadioMaterials, which have been updated based on the new frequency. The materials’ properties shown include conductivity, relative permittivity, and complex relative permittivity, among others.

Modifying the carrier frequency will influence the ray tracing outcomes, including path loss, delay spread, and multipath angle spread. These alterations occur because material interactions like reflection, transmission, and absorption depend on the signal frequency. It’s then crucial for precise simulations to choose a carrier frequency that matches the intended operational frequency band for the wireless system being modeled.

INSTRUCTION: Customize the RadioMaterial properties of a selected object within the scene and print the object's electromagnetic properties at different frequencies to understand the frequency dependency.
ANSWER:To customize the `RadioMaterial` properties of a selected object in the given Sionna RT simulation and to print the object's electromagnetic properties at different frequencies, you would follow these steps:

1. First, select an object in the scene whose `RadioMaterial` you want to customize. Use the method `get()` to retrieve the object, similar to the example provided. This method requires the name of the object as a string, which can be found in the scene file or obtained from a list of materials used in the scene:

```python
# Select the object you want to customize
selected_object_name = "Name_of_the_Object"  # Replace with the actual object name
selected_object = scene.get(selected_object_name)
```

2. Customize the properties of the `RadioMaterial` associated with the selected object. You can change properties such as conductivity, relative permittivity, and any other parameters that are relevant and modifiable:

```python
# Customize the RadioMaterial properties for the selected object
selected_object.radio_material.conductivity = <New_Conductivity_Value>
selected_object.radio_material.relative_permittivity = <New_Relative_Permittivity_Value>
# Set other electromagnetic properties as required
```

3. To understand the frequency dependency, you would set the scene frequency to various values and then print the properties of the `RadioMaterial` for each frequency. Wrap this logic in a loop that iterates through a list of frequencies:

```python
# Define a list of frequencies at which you want to examine the electromagnetic properties
frequencies = [2.4e9, 3.5e9, 5.0e9]  # Example frequencies in Hz

# Loop through the defined frequencies and print out the properties of the RadioMaterial
for f in frequencies:
    scene.frequency = f  # Update the scene frequency
    print(f"\nElectromagnetic properties of '{selected_object_name}' at {f/1e9:.2f}GHz:")
    print("Conductivity:", selected_object.radio_material.conductivity.numpy())
    print("Relative permittivity:", selected_object.radio_material.relative_permittivity.numpy())
    print("Complex relative permittivity:", selected_object.radio_material.complex_relative_permittivity.numpy())
    print("Relative permeability:", selected_object.radio_material.relative_permeability.numpy())
    print("Scattering coefficient:", selected_object.radio_material.scattering_coefficient.numpy())
    print("XPD coefficient:", selected_object.radio_material.xpd_coefficient.numpy())
```

Make sure to replace `<New_Conductivity_Value>`, `<New_Relative_Permittivity_Value>`, and any other placeholders with actual numerical values or expressions that you would like to set for the `RadioMaterial` properties.

Adjust the frequencies list according to the specific frequencies of interest for your simulation. The above code will print the electromagnetic properties at those frequencies after updating the RadioMaterial properties.

Remember to keep the rest of your simulation code consistent with these changes, so your subsequent calculations reflect these customizations.

INSTRUCTION: Run the ray tracing process to compute propagation paths between the configured transmitters and receivers and set the maximum number of interactions (max_depth). Visualize the paths using either the 3D preview or scene preview mode if supported.
ANSWER:Based on the given context, you'll be working with the Sionna RT module for ray tracing in a radio propagation scenario. To run the ray tracing process, compute propagation paths, set the maximum number of interactions (max_depth), and visualize the paths, follow these key steps:

1. **Configure your GPU and environment**: It's important to ensure that your GPU is configured correctly and that Sionna is imported properly into your environment, which seems to be already done in the context provided.

2. **Set up the scene with transmitters and receivers**: You must have the scene set up with transmitters and receivers already configured. According to the context, this step involves adding instances of `Transmitter` and `Receiver` to your scene and configuring antenna arrays for each using `PlanarArray`.

3. **Run the ray tracing process**: To compute the propagation paths, you will invoke the `compute_paths` method on your scene object with a specified `max_depth`. This parameter controls the maximum number of interactions a ray can have with scene objects (like reflections off of walls).

4. **Visualize the results**: You can visualize the propagation paths using either 3D preview or scene preview modes, depending on whether you're using Google Colab or not (as mentioned in the context, Colab does not support the preview at the time the context was given).

Given that you may not be able to run the actual code here, I will describe what the invocation would generally look like, based on the context provided:

```python
# Compute propagation paths with a given maximum number of interactions
max_depth = 5 # Replace with your desired maximum depth
paths = scene.compute_paths(max_depth=max_depth,
                            num_samples=1e6)  # The number of rays shot into directions defined by a Fibonacci sphere

# Visualize paths in the appropriate preview mode
if colab_compat:
    # Use the 3D preview mode - suitable if running in an environment that does not support 'scene.preview'
    scene.render("my_cam", paths=paths, show_devices=True, show_paths=True, resolution=resolution)
else:
    # Use the regular scene preview mode, which provides an interactive visualization
    scene.preview(paths, show_devices=True, show_paths=True)  # Mouse interaction may be enabled to focus on paths
```

Make sure to review your codebase and the Sionna documentation for any updates or changes that might affect how these functions and methods are used. The snippet above is based on the context and workflow described in the given instructions, and it should be adapted as necessary to fit into the existing project framework.

INSTRUCTION: Analyze the contents of the Paths object generated from the ray tracing process to extract source and target coordinates, transmitter and receiver positions, and path types.
ANSWER:Analyzing the Paths object from a ray tracing process involves understanding the information that the object holds regarding the propagation paths. The Paths object is a crucial component in Sionna's ray tracing module and contains all the paths found between transmitters and receivers in a given scene, which can typically include line-of-sight (LoS), reflected, diffracted, and scattered paths.

Here's how you can extract the relevant information based on the context provided:

1. **Source and Target Coordinates**: These are the starting and ending points of the rays, corresponding to the transmitter and receiver locations, respectively. You can access them using `paths.sources` and `paths.targets`.

2. **Transmitter and Receiver Positions**: Although they are essentially the same as the source and target coordinates in the context of ray tracing, if you need the actual positions assigned for the transmitter and receiver objects in the scene, you can use `scene.transmitters` and `scene.receivers`. These collections might include multiple transmitter and receiver instances.

3. **Path Types**: The types of paths can be obtained from the `paths.types` property. Typically, these are represented as integers with predefined meaning such as 0 for LoS, 1 for reflected paths, etc.

To access the data, you will generally use the `numpy()` method on the Paths object properties to convert the tensor data into a readable format, as seen in the provided context. Now, let's walk through the steps based on the context:

```python
# Access the source coordinates
source_coordinates = paths.sources.numpy()
print("Source coordinates: ", source_coordinates)

# Access the target coordinates
target_coordinates = paths.targets.numpy()
print("Target coordinates: ", target_coordinates)

# Access the transmitter position
# Assuming there is at least one transmitter
transmitter_positions = [tx.position.numpy() for tx in scene.transmitters.values()]
print("Transmitter positions: ", transmitter_positions)

# Access the receiver position
# Assuming there is at least one receiver
receiver_positions = [rx.position.numpy() for rx in scene.receivers.values()]
print("Receiver positions: ", receiver_positions)

# Access the path types
path_types = paths.types.numpy()
print("Path types: ", path_types)
```

Please note that your system might be set to a scene with a single transmitter and receiver, hence why we see only one source and one target coordinate printed. If your scene includes multiple transmitters or receivers, the corresponding properties will include coordinates for all of them, and you should handle them accordingly.

Finally, based on the context, the code included in the explanation is required here for a clear and accurate demonstration of how to extract the relevant information from a Paths object in Sionna's ray tracing module.

INSTRUCTION: Inspect the channel coefficient, propagation delay, and angles of departure and arrival for individual paths using the Paths object properties to understand the detailed radio path information.
ANSWER:To inspect the channel coefficient, propagation delay, and angles of departure and arrival for individual paths using the `Paths` object properties in Sionna RT, you will need to access specific attributes of the `Paths` object. The `Paths` object contains detailed information about each propagation path calculated during the ray tracing process. Here's how you can do this step by step:

1. **Access the Channel Coefficient:**
   The complex channel coefficient for each path can be found in the `a` attribute of the `Paths` object. This coefficient captures the attenuation and phase shift introduced by the path.

   ```python
   path_idx = 4  # Example path index
   channel_coefficient = paths.a[0,0,0,0,0,path_idx, 0].numpy()
   print(f"Channel coefficient for path {path_idx}: {channel_coefficient}")
   ```

2. **Access the Propagation Delay:**
   Propagation delay for each path is stored in the `tau` attribute. It represents the time it takes for the signal to travel through the path from the transmitter to the receiver.

   ```python
   propagation_delay = paths.tau[0,0,0,path_idx].numpy() * 1e6  # Convert to microseconds for readability
   print(f"Propagation delay for path {path_idx}: {propagation_delay:.5f} us")
   ```

3. **Access the Angles of Departure and Arrival:**
   The angles of departure (AoD) and arrival (AoA) specify the direction of the ray at the transmitter (departure) and at the receiver (arrival). They are divided into zenith and azimuth angles and can be found in the `theta_t` and `phi_t` attributes for departure, and `theta_r` and `phi_r` for arrival, respectively.

   ```python
   zenith_angle_of_departure = paths.theta_t[0,0,0,path_idx].numpy()
   azimuth_angle_of_departure = paths.phi_t[0,0,0,path_idx].numpy()
   print(f"Zenith angle of departure for path {path_idx}: {zenith_angle_of_departure:.4f} rad")
   print(f"Azimuth angle of departure for path {path_idx}: {azimuth_angle_of_departure:.4f} rad")
   
   zenith_angle_of_arrival = paths.theta_r[0,0,0,path_idx].numpy()
   azimuth_angle_of_arrival = paths.phi_r[0,0,0,path_idx].numpy()
   print(f"Zenith angle of arrival for path {path_idx}: {zenith_angle_of_arrival:.4f} rad")
   print(f"Azimuth angle of arrival for path {path_idx}: {azimuth_angle_of_arrival:.4f} rad")
   ```

Please note that `path_idx` is an example index for a single path; you may want to loop over all paths or select a specific one based on your analysis. The given context assumes that the `Paths` object has already been computed and assigned to the variable `paths`. If you wish to inspect different paths, you will need to change the `path_idx` value accordingly. Remember that the indexes in Python are zero-based, so a `path_idx` of `4` actually refers to the fifth path in the list.

INSTRUCTION: Execute a specific code cell to preview the ray-traced paths in the scene and discuss how to troubleshoot if the preview does not appear due to multiple instances being open.
ANSWER:To execute a specific code cell to preview the ray-traced paths in the scene within the notebook using Sionna RT (as per the provided context), you would need to locate the correct code cell with the relevant code for rendering the preview. According to the given context, this would likely be the cell with the label `[11]:`. Here is the transcription of the code block you might look for:

```python
# Compute propagation paths
paths = scene.compute_paths(max_depth=5,
                            num_samples=1e6)  # Number of rays shot into directions defined
                                              # by a Fibonacci sphere, too few rays can
                                              # lead to missing paths
# Visualize paths in the 3D preview
if colab_compat:
    scene.render("my_cam", paths=paths, show_devices=True, show_paths=True, resolution=resolution);
    raise ExitCell
scene.preview(paths, show_devices=True, show_paths=True) # Use the mouse to focus on the visualized paths
```

To execute this cell, you can typically click on it and press `Shift + Enter` if you are running the Jupyter Notebook. If the preview of the ray-traced paths does not appear after executing this cell, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check for Errors**: Review the output for any error messages. Common issues might include missing imports, syntax errors, or runtime errors related to `scene`, `paths`, or other objects/functions called in the cell.

2. **Review Multiple Instances Advice**: The instructions note that if no preview appears, you should check for previous preview instances. Close any other notebook instances or previews that might still be open since it's mentioned that only one preview instance can be open at the same time.

3. **Resource Availability**: Ensure that the GPU or other resources are not being overutilized by other processes. You might need to close other applications or notebooks that use the GPU.

4. **Check Compatibility**: The context comments indicate that the preview does not work in Colab, and recommend using the scene preview mode when possible. If you are using Google Colab, the preview functionality might not be supported due to the existing limitations of the platform.

5. **Check Environment Variables**: Review the code setup for any environment variable issues, such as `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and ensure the GPU is correctly configured.

6. **Inspect Output Logs**: Sometimes, the preview might generate output logs which could provide insights into what went wrong. Check these logs for any warnings or errors.

7. **Consult Documentation**: Reference the Sionna RT documentation for any notes on preview troubleshooting or related issues to get more specific advice on handling the preview generation.

Remember that each troubleshooting step could give you additional information about the issue, so it's a good idea to tackle them one by one and test if the problem is resolved after each step. If these attempts do not resolve the issue, you may need to seek help from the software and library documentation or the community forums dedicated to the tool you are using.
