INSTRUCTION: Explain how to instantiate a 5G-compliant Polar encoder with specific parameters for information and codeword bits using Sionna.
ANSWER:To instantiate a 5G-compliant Polar encoder using the Sionna library, you need to specify parameters for the number of information bits (k) and the number of codeword bits (n). The `Polar5GEncoder` class is used for this purpose. Here are the steps to accomplish this:

1. Import the necessary module from Sionna for Polar coding.

2. Instantiate a `Polar5GEncoder` object with the required `k` and `n` parameters.

Here's a snippet of Python code based on the context provided that demonstrates how to instantiate a `Polar5GEncoder` with specific parameters for information and codeword bits:

```python
from sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder

# Specify the number of information bits and codeword bits
k = 100  # replace with your desired number of information bits
n = 200  # replace with your desired number of codeword bits

# Instantiate the Polar5GEncoder
encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)
```

Make sure to replace the `100` and `200` for `k` and `n`, respectively, with the actual values that are specific to your application. Once instantiated, this encoder can be used to encode information bits into codeword bits that are compliant with 5G Polar code specifications.

INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate how to create a Polar5GDecoder that is connected to a previously defined encoder for SCL decoding with a list size of 8.
ANSWER:To create a `Polar5GDecoder` that is connected to a previously defined encoder, especially for Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding with a list size of 8, you would follow these general steps in Python using the Sionna library, assuming that the encoder instance has already been created and is named `encoder`:

1. Import the necessary module for the `Polar5GDecoder`.
2. Create an instance of `Polar5GDecoder`, ensuring to pass in the previously defined `encoder` instance and set the `dec_type` to `"SCL"` and the `list_size` to `8`.

Here's how you would generally write the Python code:

```python
from sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder

# Assuming the encoder instance is already created as follows:
# encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)

# Now, create a Polar5GDecoder instance connected to the encoder
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, # Connect the Polar decoder to the encoder
                         dec_type="SCL",  # Specify decoder type as SCL
                         list_size=8)     # Set list size to 8 for SCL decoding
```

This decoder can then be used to decode the information:

```python
# Assuming llr is the input log-likelihood ratio with the shape [..., n]
# The decoded information bits will be in u_hat with shape [..., k]
u_hat = decoder(llr)
```

Please ensure that you have installed the Sionna library and have already defined an instance of `Polar5GEncoder` before trying to instantiate `Polar5GDecoder` as shown in the example above.

INSTRUCTION: Write a code snippet to encode information bits using the Polar5GEncoder instance.
ANSWER:Based on the given context, to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` instance that was created in the context, you will need to have an array `u` containing the information bits you want to encode. The array `u` should have a shape that ends in `k`, where `k` is the number of information bits, which was previously set to 100 during the creation of the `Polar5GEncoder` instance.

Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` instance, named `encoder`, to encode the information bits contained in `u`:

```python
# Assuming `encoder` is a previously created instance of Polar5GEncoder with k=100 and n=200

# `u` is a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor containing the information bits to be encoded
# It should have the shape [..., k], where the '...' represents any number of preceding dimensions
# For example, `u` could be a 1D array of shape [100] if encoding a single codeword

import numpy as np
# Generating some random information bits to encode
# For your actual application, replace this with your actual information bits
u = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))

# Perform the Polar encoding operation
c = encoder(u)

# `c` now contains the polar encoded codewords with shape [..., n]
# Where 'n' is the number of codeword bits which was previously set to 200
```

The above code assumes the `encoder` instance has been previously set up as shown in the provided context and `u` is available containing the bits to encode. The encoded result `c` will then have the shape `[..., n]` where `n` was set to 200 during the instantiation of the `Polar5GEncoder`. 

Please replace the random bit generation part with your actual bit source that needs to be encoded.

INSTRUCTION: Provide an example of decoding log-likelihood ratios (LLR) to estimate information bits using the Polar5GDecoder instance.
ANSWER:To provide an example of decoding log-likelihood ratios (LLR) using the `Polar5GDecoder` instance to estimate information bits, we can build upon the context provided. We'll assume that the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` are already instantiated as per the context setup. Now, let's proceed with an example where we have an input LLR array, and we are going to use the decoder to estimate the information bits.

First, we set up the environment, create an encoder and decoder as per the context provided, and prepare an example LLR input to be decoded.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder

# Setup the Polar5GEncoder with given parameters
encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)

# Setup the Polar5GDecoder corresponding to the encoder with a specified list_size for SCL decoding
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type="SCL", list_size=8)

# Example LLR input for decoding - typically this comes from a channel demodulator 
# Here we create an example tensor with random values as placeholder
# Assuming a batch size of 1 for simplicity
llr = tf.random.normal([1, 200])  # Shape [batch_size, n]

# Use the decoder to estimate the information bits from the LLR input
u_hat = decoder(llr)
```

In this example, `llr` is a tensor of log-likelihood ratios, which is required to be of shape [..., 200] where 200 is the codeword length `n` specified in the encoder. This LLR input is then passed to the `Polar5GDecoder` instance `decoder` to obtain the estimate of the information bits `u_hat`, which will be a tensor of shape [..., 100] because the number of information bits `k` is 100.

To conclude, the `Polar5GDecoder` will process the LLR input `llr` and provide the estimate `u_hat`. In a realistic scenario, the LLR would come from the demodulated received signal which has passed through a communication channel and a demapper, which are activities not shown in this particular example.

INSTRUCTION: Detail the procedure for creating a Polar5GDecoder instance with custom parameters like decoder type, list size, number of BP iterations, return of CRC status, and output data type.
ANSWER:To create a `Polar5GDecoder` instance with custom parameters like decoder type, list size, number of BP iterations, return of CRC status, and output data type, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have an instance of `Polar5GEncoder`. This is required because the decoder needs to be connected to the corresponding encoder to function correctly. If you do not have one already, you will need to create it like this:

```python
encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=100, n=200)
```
Here, `k` is the number of information bits and `n` is the codeword length.

2. With the encoder instance ready, you can now create the `Polar5GDecoder` by providing it with the necessary parameters. Here is an example of creating a `Polar5GDecoder` with custom parameters:

```python
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(enc_polar=encoder,        # Instance of `Polar5GEncoder`
                         dec_type="SCL",           # Decoder type (can be "SC", "SCL", "hybSCL", or "BP")
                         list_size=8,              # List size for list-based decoding types
                         num_iter=20,              # Number of belief propagation iterations for "BP" decoder
                         return_crc_status=True,   # Whether to return CRC status
                         output_dtype=tf.float32)  # Output data type
```
In this example:
- `enc_polar` is the encoder instance you created in the first step.
- `dec_type` is set to `"SCL"` for the Successive Cancellation List decoding but can be changed as needed to one of the acceptable types provided in the context.
- `list_size` is set to 8, which is a standard list size for 5G decoding, but it can be adjusted based on your requirements, and it's applicable only for list-based decoding types such as "SCL" or "hybSCL".
- `num_iter` is relevant only if you use the "BP" decoder type and specifies the number of iterations in the belief propagation process.
- `return_crc_status` is set to `True`, indicating that you would like the decoder to return the CRC status in addition to the estimated information bits.
- `output_dtype` specifies the output data type; it is set to TensorFlow's `tf.float32` in this case, but you can change it according to your needs.

3. After instantiating the `Polar5GDecoder` with your custom parameters, you can use it to decode the received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios). Below is an example of how to use the decoder with input `llr`:

```python
# 'llr' contains the input LLRs with shape [..., n]
u_hat, crc_status = decoder(llr)
```

In the above code, `llr` is the tensor containing your log-likelihood ratios, `u_hat` holds the estimated information bits, and `crc_status` indicates whether each codeword was likely correctly recovered if you set `return_crc_status` to `True`.

Make sure to match the input shape and data type to the `Polar5GDecoder` specifications when passing the input `llr` values. If `return_crc_status` is set to `False`, the decoder will only return `u_hat`.

Remember, you will need to import TensorFlow and any other necessary modules or classes to work with these instances.

INSTRUCTION: Show how to access and interpret the output of a Polar5GDecoder, including how to check the CRC status of the decoded codeword.
ANSWER:To access and interpret the output of a `Polar5GDecoder` and check the CRC status of the decoded codeword, you should follow these steps:

1. **Instantiate the Polar5GDecoder**: You must create an instance of `Polar5GDecoder` by providing the necessary parameters like the `encoder` instance (an instance of `Polar5GEncoder`), the decoder type, and other configuration specifics pertinent to the decoder type you're using. In particular, ensure that you set the `return_crc_status` parameter to `True` to make the decoder provide the CRC status as part of its output.

```python
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder,  # Instance of Polar5GEncoder
                         dec_type="SCL",   # Type of decoder: "SC", "SCL", "BP"
                         list_size=8,      # Required for list decoding types ("SCL", "hybSCL")
                         return_crc_status=True)  # To get CRC status in the output
```

2. **Run the Decoder**: You need to provide the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) of the received codeword to the decoder instance. The output will be the estimated information bits, and if `return_crc_status` was set to `True`, the CRC status as well.

```python
u_hat, crc_status = decoder(llr)
```

3. **Interpret the Output**: The variable `u_hat` will contain the estimated information bits resulting from the decoding process, and `crc_status` will indicate whether each codeword was likely correctly recovered (based on CRC). The `crc_status` is a tensor with boolean values where `True` indicates a passed CRC check.

4. **Assess CRC Status**: By examining `crc_status`, you can determine which codewords have been likely decoded correctly. Codewords with a `True` status have passed the CRC check, suggesting they are error-free, while those with a `False` status may still contain errors.

Here's an example snippet putting it all together:

```python
# Instantiate the decoder (assuming encoder is already created)
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder,
                         dec_type="SCL",
                         list_size=8,
                         return_crc_status=True)

# Assume 'llr' contains the log-likelihood ratios from the channel
# Run the decoder
u_hat, crc_status = decoder(llr)

# Check CRC status for each codeword
for i, crc in enumerate(crc_status):
    if crc:
        print(f"Codeword {i} passed CRC check.")
    else:
        print(f"Codeword {i} failed CRC check.")
```

This example provides a basic outline for interpreting the output from `Polar5GDecoder` including the CRC status. The actual implementation may vary depending on additional code specifics, the shape of your inputs, and other factors related to the use case.

INSTRUCTION: Clarify what errors might be raised by Polar5GDecoder and under what conditions these errors would occur.
ANSWER:Based on the provided context, `Polar5GDecoder` could raise several types of errors under specific conditions:

1. **AssertionError**: This error is raised if the `enc_polar` argument provided to `Polar5GDecoder` is not an instance of `Polar5GEncoder`. This check ensures that the decoder is compatible with the encoder used during the encoding process.

2. **ValueError**: Various value errors can occur:
    - If the `dec_type` parameter is not one of the specified strings: `"SC"`, `"SCL"`, `"hybSCL"`, or `"BP"`. This parameter defines the type of decoder to be used and must be one of the allowed values.
    - If the `inputs` tensor does not have the correct shape of `[..., n]` or the data type of `inputs` does not match the defined `output_dtype`. The shape `[..., n]` refers to the expected dimensionality of the input log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), with `n` being the number of codeword bits.

3. **InvalidArgumentError**: This is raised when the rank (dimensionality) of the `inputs` tensor is less than 2. The `inputs` tensor is expected to be at least 2-dimensional, where the additional dimensions serve as batch axes or other forms of grouping for multiple decoding processes.

It is important to note that these errors are aimed at ensuring the correctness of the parameters provided to the `Polar5GDecoder` and the format of its inputs during usage. Each error points to a specific kind of data contract violation, such as incorrect types, shapes, or value domains, that would prevent the decoder from functioning correctly.

INSTRUCTION: Explain the practicality of the Polar5GDecoder layer supporting the uplink and downlink Polar rate-matching scheme in Sionna.
ANSWER:The `Polar5GDecoder` layer in Sionna is a valuable tool for decoding Polar codes - a type of error-correcting code introduced for use in 5G New Radio (NR) - due to its flexibility in accommodating the Polar rate-matching scheme for both uplink and downlink communication channels.

In cellular communication systems, data sent from mobile devices to the base station is referred to as uplink, while data sent from the base station to mobile devices is called downlink. Rate matching in this context refers to the process of adjusting the code rate of the transmitted codewords to suit the current channel conditions and available bandwidth. Polar codes utilize a specific rate-matching algorithm defined in the 5G standard to ensure that this process is efficient and consistent with the performance requirements of 5G NR.

The practicality of using the `Polar5GDecoder` layer for supporting the uplink and downlink Polar rate-matching scheme is primarily due to its compliance with the 5G NR standard and its integration with the Keras model as a layer, which allows for easy use and incorporation into communication system simulations and models. It is designed to handle decoding tasks that include rate-recovery and CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) removal, which are essential for detecting and correcting errors in the transmission. The layer also allows for various types of decoding (SC, SCL, BP), list sizes, numbers of BP iterations, and offers the flexibility to return the CRC status, indicating whether a codeword has likely been correctly recovered.

The ability to handle different decoder types, such as SC (Successive Cancellation), SCL (Successive Cancellation List), and BP (Belief Propagation) decoding, means the `Polar5GDecoder` can be tuned for different performance and complexity trade-offs, which is practical from an implementation viewpoint. SCL decoders, for example, are known to achieve better error-correction performance by considering multiple decoding paths, but they are also more complex. The option to choose a list size of 8 is based on an industry agreement for the 5G decoding reference curves, despite it not being specified by the 3GPP.

Another practical aspect is the support for CRC-aided decoding in the list decoders, which helps improve the error-correction performance by leveraging the additional error detection capability of the CRC. This is particularly useful because some decoders, like SC and BP, cannot utilize CRC to aid in decoding, resulting in an effective rate loss.

Lastly, the layer supports uplink and downlink Polar rate-matching schemes without requiring codeword segmentation, which simplifies the decoding process for varying lengths of data and reduces complexity.

Therefore, the `Polar5GDecoder` in Sionna is practically designed to suit a wide range of decoding scenarios in the 5G NR uplink and downlink channels, which makes it a versatile and vital component in the physical layer communication stack of 5G systems.

INSTRUCTION: Identify how to leverage the properties of the Polar5GDecoder, such as `dec_type`, `frozen_pos`, `info_pos`, `k_polar`, `n_polar`, and `output_dtype`.
ANSWER:To leverage the properties of the `Polar5GDecoder`, you should understand their role and how they can be used to optimize the decoding process according to the specific requirements of your application. Here are explanations of the listed properties and suggestions for their use:

- **`dec_type`**: This property specifies the type of decoder to be used - Successive Cancellation (SC), Successive Cancellation List (SCL), or Belief Propagation (BP). Depending on the channel conditions and performance requirements, you may choose SCL for better error correction performance at the cost of higher complexity or SC for lower complexity with reduced performance. BP can be used when a balance between complexity and performance is required.

- **`frozen_pos`**: These are the positions in the Polar codeword that are set to a known value (often zero) and are not used for transmitting information. Proper selection of frozen positions is critical for achieving good error correction performance. These positions depend on the channel characteristics and can be optimized for specific scenarios.

- **`info_pos`**: In contrast to `frozen_pos`, these positions carry the information bits in the Polar codeword. By ensuring that `info_pos` aligns with the most reliable channel positions, you can improve the code's resilience to errors.

- **`k_polar`**: This parameter represents the number of information bits in the Polar code before any rate-matching or CRC additions. To leverage `k_polar`, you need to ensure that it correctly matches the number of information bits your application requires.

- **`n_polar`**: It indicates the total length of the Polar codeword. You can use `n_polar` to ensure that the code length is compatible with the frame size used in your communication system. The choice of `n_polar` may also affect the error correction performance and decoding complexity.

- **`output_dtype`**: The data type of the decoder's output can be chosen based on system requirements. In some scenarios, memory and computational resources may be limited, influencing the choice towards a lower precision type. Alternatively, higher precision might be chosen for better performance if resources allow.

In summary, to leverage these properties, you should align the Polar code parameters (`k_polar`, `n_polar`, `frozen_pos`, `info_pos`) with your channel conditions and system constraints. Choose the `dec_type` based on your error correction performance and computational complexity trade-offs. Finally, select the `output_dtype` that best suits your system's performance requirements and resource constraints.

Careful tuning of these properties can help in achieving an efficient balance between decoding performance and resource usage, providing robust communications tailored for the specific needs of your application.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the purpose of the PolarSCDecoder and how to create an instance with specified parameters like frozen positions and codeword length.
ANSWER:The PolarSCDecoder is designed to perform successive cancellation (SC) decoding for Polar codes and Polar-like codes. The purpose of this decoder is to translate received information from a communication channel into probable transmitted information bits. Polar codes utilize specific positions called "frozen positions," where the values are known a priori at both the encoder and the decoder. By knowing these positions, the decoder can use this information to aid in the error correction process.

To create an instance of the PolarSCDecoder with specified parameters like frozen positions and codeword length, the following Python code snippet can be used:

```python
from sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarSCDecoder

# Define the frozen positions in an array (example: positions 0 and 1 are frozen)
frozen_positions = [0, 1]

# Define the codeword length (n must be a power of 2, for example 4)
codeword_length = 4

# (Optional) Define the output data type, default is tf.float32
output_dtype = tf.float32

# Create an instance of the PolarSCDecoder
sc_decoder = PolarSCDecoder(frozen_pos=frozen_positions, n=codeword_length, output_dtype=output_dtype)
```

In this example:

- `frozen_positions` defines a list or array containing the indices of the frozen bits in the codeword.
- `codeword_length` specifies the length of the codeword. This value must be a power of 2 due to the nature of Polar codes.
- `output_dtype` sets the output data type of the decoder, which by default is set to `tf.float32`. You may also use `tf.float16` or `tf.float64` if required.

To use the instantiated `sc_decoder`, one would pass the received log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) through the decode method of the `sc_decoder`, as shown in the context. The decoder will output an estimate of the transmitted information bits.

Please note that the actual Python package providing the `PolarSCDecoder` should be imported correctly to use in the code, as illustrated in the snippet. The details of the decoder's response shape are not provided in the context, but typically, the output would match the dimensions of the information bits (k positions not frozen).

INSTRUCTION: Outline how to feed LLR values to the PolarSCDecoder instance and obtain the hard-decided estimations of information bits.
ANSWER:To feed Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) values to a `PolarSCDecoder` instance and obtain the hard-decided estimations of the information bits in a Python environment, you can follow these steps assuming you have the Sionna library installed and have a basic understanding of its use. Here's a general outline of the process:

1. **Instantiate the PolarSCDecoder:**
   Before feeding LLR values, you need to create an instance of `PolarSCDecoder`. You must define the `frozen_pos` and `n` parameters according to your Polar code's specification, where `frozen_pos` is an array of indices indicating the positions of frozen bits in the codeword, and `n` is the length of the codeword.

```python
from sionna.fec.polar.decoding import PolarSCDecoder

# Provide the indices of the frozen bits and the codeword length
frozen_pos = [...]  # This should be a list of the positions of frozen bits
n = ...  # Codeword length which must be a power of 2

# Instantiate the decoder
sc_decoder = PolarSCDecoder(frozen_pos=frozen_pos, n=n)
```

2. **Prepare the LLR values:**
   The LLR values are typically obtained from the output of a demapper, which processes the received signal and computes the LLRs for each bit. Ensure that the LLRs are in the correct format and shape expected by the decoder. The shape of the LLR input should be `[..., n]`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming `llr_values` is a tensor with the LLR values for your codeword
llr_values = tf.constant([...], dtype=tf.float32)  # Replace with actual LLR values
```

3. **Feed the LLR values to the decoder:**
   Call the PolarSCDecoder instance with the LLR values to perform decoding.

```python
# Decode the LLRs to get the hard-decided estimations of the information bits
decoded_bits = sc_decoder(llr_values)
```

4. **Interpret the result:**
   The output `decoded_bits` is a tensor containing the hard decisions for the information bits. You may further process these bits as required by your application.

The above steps will feed the LLR values to the PolarSCDecoder and produce the hard-decided bit estimations. Note that the actual Polar code parameters and LLR values must replace the placeholders in the example code.

Keep in mind that when working with actual code, you should handle potential exceptions and ensure that the input LLR values and Polar code parameters are configured correctly for your specific communication system scenario.

INSTRUCTION: Discuss the possible errors that might be raised by PolarSCDecoder and detail the conditions that might lead to them.
ANSWER:The possible errors raised by the `PolarSCDecoder` from the Polar code module in the given context include the following:

1. **AssertionError** - This error may be raised under several conditions:
    - If the provided codeword length (`n`) is not an integer, an assertion error is raised to ensure that the codeword length is specified as an integer value.
    - If the codeword length is not a power of 2. The polar codes are based on the concept of channel polarization, which typically requires the length of the codeword to be a power of 2.
    - If the number of elements in `frozen_pos` exceeds `n`. The `frozen_pos` array specifies the indices of frozen bits, and its size should be less than or equal to the length of the codeword since `frozen_pos` represents the positions that are not used for information bits.
    - If `frozen_pos` does not consist of integers. Since `frozen_pos` represents indices, it should only contain integer values that specify the positions of the frozen bits within the codeword.

2. **ValueError** - This error is raised when:
    - The `output_dtype` parameter is not among the specified TensorFlow data types `{tf.float16, tf.float32, tf.float64}`. The data type of the output is expected to be one of these TensorFlow-supported floating-point types, and any deviation will result in a ValueError.

It's important to note that the `PolarSCDecoder` is designed to work with inputs that adhere to specific requirements — such as the codeword length being a power of 2 and the indices in `frozen_pos` being valid — to ensure proper decoding of polar codes. Any deviation from these requirements could lead to incorrect decoding behavior or the aforementioned errors. 

The `PolarSCDecoder` class is a part of a more extensive coding scheme that supports various polar decoding methods, and it is meant to be used within a Keras model framework, where these assertions and checks help to maintain the integrity of the data and the correctness of the algorithm within the model. The class follows the recursive tree terminology for efficient implementation, and proper usage requires understanding the structure and properties of polar codes.

INSTRUCTION: Elaborate on how the PolarSCDecoder implements the recursive tree SC decoder algorithm and how it handles frozen bits by default.
ANSWER:The `PolarSCDecoder` implements the successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm for Polar codes as described in the literature, specifically following the methodology in references [Arikan_Polar] and [Gross_Fast_SCL]. This decoder is part of a larger set of functionalities included in the Polar codes module of Sionna, which supports 5G-compliant Polar codes with various decoding algorithms such as SC, SCL, and BP decoding.

The SC decoding algorithm is a recursive process that operates on a binary tree structure, where the leaves of the tree correspond to the bits of the codeword. Each node in the binary tree represents a decoding step. For a Polar code of length `n`, the binary tree has `log2(n)` levels, and the SC decoder traverses this tree depth-first to estimate the codeword bit-by-bit in a successive manner. The key idea behind the SC decoder is its ability to exploit the code's inherent recursive structure to efficiently estimate each bit given the estimates of previous bits.

Now how does the `PolarSCDecoder` handle frozen bits by default? Frozen bits are predefined positions in the codeword that are set to a known value, usually zero. These positions do not carry information and thus, are not used to encode message bits. When performing SC decoding, the decoder already knows the value of the frozen bits and thus whenever it encounters a frozen position during the decoding process, it simply assigns it the known value without any computation. This is typically done to ensure that the decoder adheres to the code structure and does not waste resources on decoding bits that do not contain any informational content.

The snippet from the context related to `PolarSCDecoder` provides insight into the set-up of the decoder in a typical application. As shown, the decoder is initialized with the `frozen_pos`, which is an array of integers indicating the indices of the frozen positions, and `n`, defining the codeword length. These parameters are crucial as they outline the structure of the Polar code being decoded. The input to the `PolarSCDecoder` is a tensor containing the channel log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values, and the output is a tensor containing hard-decided estimations of the information bits.

Here's an example of initializing `PolarSCDecoder`:

```python
# `frozen_pos` is an array of integers defining the indices of the frozen positions
# `n` is the codeword length
polar_sc_decoder = PolarSCDecoder(frozen_pos, n, output_dtype=tf.float32)
```

As commonly done, the `PolarSCDecoder` assumes frozen bits are set to zero. The note in the context indicates that while it is possible to set frozen bits to one, which could result in affine codes instead of linear codes, the common practice and assumption is to use zero. This means that, by default, indices in `frozen_pos` are assigned a zero during the decoding process.

The implementation details for the recursive tree SC decoding and handling of the frozen bits are abstracted away from the user but are consistent with the described literature. This means that the internal workings of `PolarSCDecoder` is based on merging nodes for increased throughput, without affecting the outcome of the recursive decoding algorithm. The combination of nodes as mentioned in reference [Gross_Fast_SCL] likely refers to optimizations that allow the SC decoder to work more efficiently without deviating from the standard SC algorithm described by Arikan.
