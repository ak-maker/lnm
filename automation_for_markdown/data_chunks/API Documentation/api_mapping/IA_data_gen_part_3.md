INSTRUCTION: Explain the purpose of the `Mapper`, `Constellation`, and `Demapper` classes in Sionna.
ANSWER:In the context provided, the `Mapper`, `Constellation`, and `Demapper` classes are part of Sionna, a library for simulating communication systems. Each of these classes has a specific role in the processing of digital signals for communication systems:

1. `Constellation`: This class represents the mapping of bits to constellation points (symbols) in a communication system. The constellation defines how bits are represented as symbols in a modulated signal. These symbols are points in a geometric space, like the complex plane for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). The `Constellation` class is capable of representing standard constellations such as QAM and Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), but it can also be made trainable to enable geometric shaping. This means that the positions of the constellation points can be optimized as part of a machine learning process to potentially increase the robustness or capacity of the communication system.

2. `Mapper`: The `Mapper` class is responsible for the process of taking input bits and converting these bits into symbols according to a defined constellation. This is known as modulation, where a sequence of bits is transformed into an analog signal that can be transmitted over a physical medium. The `Mapper` class leverages the `Constellation` class to perform this operation and is an essential step in the preparation of digital data for transmission.

3. `Demapper`: The `Demapper` class performs the inverse operation of the `Mapper`. After a signal has been transmitted and received, potentially with distortion and noise introduced by the transmission channel, the `Demapper` class is used to estimate the most likely transmitted symbols and convert them back to bits. This process, known as demodulation, typically involves calculating log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each bit, based on the received symbols and noise characteristics of the channel. The demapping function can either output soft-values (probabilities) or hard decisions (the most likely bit values), depending on whether the `hard_out` option is set to True or False. It may also utilize prior knowledge of the transmitted bits if available.

In summary, the `Constellation` class defines the possible symbol points for a given modulation scheme, the `Mapper` modulates bits into these symbol points for transmission, and the `Demapper` performs demodulation by mapping received, noisy symbols back to an estimated bit sequence. These classes jointly enable the simulation of the modulation and demodulation processes within a communication system in Sionna.

INSTRUCTION: Discuss how a `Constellation` object can be made trainable for geometric shaping in Sionna.
ANSWER:To make a `Constellation` object trainable for geometric shaping in Sionna, you would need to set up a custom constellation where the constellation points are represented by trainable parameters within a neural network. Geometric shaping implies that instead of using a predefined constellation pattern (like in QAM or PAM), the locations of the constellation points in the complex plane are learned during training to optimize some performance criteria (e.g., minimizing the bit error rate or the mutual information under a given channel and noise condition).

Given that the provided context mentions that the `Constellation` can be made trainable, we assume that the `Constellation` class in Sionna has capabilities to incorporate learnable parameters. However, there is no direct code snippet provided in the context. The actual implementation details for making `Constellation` trainable would typically go as follows:

1. Define a custom constellation where the positions of the points are not fixed but represented as learnable parameters.
2. Integrate this constellation into a system model where the constellation points can be used in forward propagation (mapping bits to complex symbols) and have gradients computed with respect to some loss function during backpropagation (when demapping and calculating error rates or other performance metrics).
3. Set up an optimization process (training loop) where these constellations' point parameters are updated using gradients from backpropagation. This requires defining a loss function that reflects the performance metric you want to optimize.

In TensorFlow (the machine learning framework used under the hood in Sionna), making a parameter trainable is often as straightforward as using `tf.Variable` with the attribute `trainable=True`. Any variable that is part of the TensorFlow computation graph and set as trainable will automatically be updated when using gradient-based optimization methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

To illustrate the concept with (hypothetical) code, imagine a simple scenario where `Constellation` is a class that can take an initial set of points and learn to adjust them:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class TrainableConstellation(tf.Module):
    def __init__(self, initial_constellation_points):
        # Initialize the constellation points as trainable parameters.
        self.constellation_points = tf.Variable(initial_constellation_points, trainable=True)

    def __call__(self, inputs):
        # Define forward computation, e.g., mapping from bits to constellation points
        # This is a placeholder for whatever mapping logic is necessary.
        return tf.nn.embedding_lookup(self.constellation_points, inputs)
```

In practice, during the training process, you would map bits to modulated symbols using the learnable constellation points, transmit these symbols through a simulation of the communication channel, and then optimize these constellation points to minimize the loss (which would likely be related to reconstruction error post-demapping, adjusted by noise, channel imperfections, and other system-related metrics).

Please note that the actual Sionna API might differ in naming and structure, but the concepts would be the same. You can dive into the Sionna documentation or source code for the exact implementation of trainability in `Constellation` objects.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the type of inputs and outputs involved when using `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` in Sionna.
ANSWER:`SymbolDemapperWithPrior` in Sionna is a component that computes normalized log-probabilities (logits) or hard-decisions on symbols for a tensor of received symbols, assuming prior knowledge on the constellation points is available. It has been deprecated, as its functionality has been integrated into `SymbolDemapper`.

The inputs involved when using `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` are:
1. **y**: A tensor of received symbols which has a shape [..., n], where `n` is the number of received symbols, and it should be of type `tf.complex` (`dtype` is `tf.complex64` by default).
2. **prior**: A tensor representing priors for every symbol as log-probabilities (logits), which can either be a single-dimensional tensor of shape [num_points] for the entire batch or a tensor that is broadcastable to the shape [..., n, num_points].
3. **no**: A scalar or tensor representing the noise variance estimate, which can be provided either as a scalar for the entire batch or as a tensor that is broadcastable to the shape of `y`.

The outputs from `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` depend on the value of the `hard_out` parameter:
- If `hard_out` is set to `False` (default), the output will be a tensor of logits for every constellation point with the shape [..., n, num_points], where `num_points` is the number of constellation points.
- Otherwise, if `hard_out` is set to `True`, the output will be a tensor of hard-decided symbols with shape [..., n].

The logits represent normalized log-probabilities, where the log-probabilities of the constellation point `c` given received symbol `y` and the prior information on constellation points as log-probabilities `p` is calculated using the provided formula in the context. The definition and calculation of these logits are important for subsequent processes such as the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for bit decisions or the training of constellation geometries when constellation points are set to be learnable (trainable).

Overall, `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` accepts complex valued symbol inputs, possibly with prior information, and outputs either logits or hard decisions based on whether soft or hard demapping is required.

INSTRUCTION: State why the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is deprecated and what class should be used instead in Sionna.
ANSWER:The `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is deprecated because its functionality has been integrated into the `SymbolDemapper` class. As a result, the `SymbolDemapper` class should be used instead to perform demapping operations when prior knowledge of constellation points is available in Sionna. This consolidation likely aims to simplify the API and reduce redundancy by having a single class handle both demapping scenarios: with and without prior knowledge.

INSTRUCTION: List the parameters required to initialize the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class in Sionna and what each parameter represents.
ANSWER:Based on the provided context, the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class in Sionna requires the following parameters for initialization, along with their representations:

- **constellation_type**: A string indicating the type of constellation to be used. This should be one of ["qam", "pam", "custom"]. For "custom", an instance of `Constellation` must be provided. This parameter defines the modulation scheme for the symbol demapper.

- **num_bits_per_symbol**: An integer specifying the number of bits per constellation symbol, such as 4 for QAM16. This parameter is required when `constellation_type` is either "qam" or "pam", and it defines the bit resolution of the modulation scheme.

- **constellation**: An instance of `Constellation`, or `None`. If `None` is provided, the `constellation_type` and `num_bits_per_symbol` parameters must be supplied. This parameter provides the constellation object that describes the set of possible symbols and their corresponding geometric representation on the complex plane.

- **hard_out**: A boolean value. If set to `True`, the demapper outputs hard-decided symbols. If set to `False`, it provides soft-values (logits). The default is `False`. This controls the output type of the demapper, determining whether it should output "hard" decisions or "soft" log-probability values.

- **dtype**: A `tf.DType` value which should be either `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`. This defines the data type for the input tensor of received symbols. The default is `tf.complex64`. The output data type will be a corresponding real dtype (`tf.float32` or `tf.float64`), depending on this input.

- **kwargs**: This represents additional keyword arguments that could be passed to the class. It is denoted in the context as `**kwargs`, suggesting the class may accept other parameters not explicitly mentioned here.

It’s important to note from the context that the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is deprecated and its functionality has been integrated into the `SymbolDemapper` class. Therefore, while these parameters were used to initialize the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class, future use cases should use the updated `SymbolDemapper` class instead.

INSTRUCTION: Illustrate how to compute normalized log-probabilities for constellation points within the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` using Sionna.
ANSWER:To compute normalized log-probabilities for constellation points within the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` using Sionna, one would follow these general steps:

1. **Instantiate the Constellation Object**: Begin by creating a `Constellation` object, which provides the points that define the constellation being used for modulation. This is necessary if you're using a custom constellation or if you want the constellation to be trainable for purposes such as geometric shaping.

2. **Prepare Input Tensors**: There are three main inputs that need to be prepared:
   - **Received Symbols (y)**: This tensor contains the complex symbols received over the channel.
   - **Prior (prior)**: This is a tensor of normalized log-probabilities (logits) that represents prior knowledge on the likelihood of each constellation point. The shape can either be `[num_points]` for the entire input batch or broadcastable to `[..., n, num_points]`.
   - **Noise Variance (no)**: The estimate of noise variance, which may be a scalar or a tensor broadcastable to the shape of the received symbols tensor `y`.

3. **Instantiate SymbolDemapperWithPrior**: Create the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` object by providing it with the necessary parameters such as the `constellation_type`, `num_bits_per_symbol`, and if necessary, the `constellation` object you instantiated earlier.

4. **Compute Log-Probabilities**: Call the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` to compute the normalized log-probabilities. This will compute a tensor output where each entry corresponds to the log-probability of a particular constellation point given the received symbol, prior, and noise variance.

The following Python code illustrates these steps. It assumes you have already defined a suitable constellation object if you are working with a non-standard constellation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna

# Instantiate the constellation object (skip if standard constellation e.g., QAM, PAM)
# constellation = CustomConstellation() # Replace with the actual init if you have a custom one

# Instantiate the demapper object with the desired parameters
demapper = sionna.mapping.SymbolDemapperWithPrior(
    constellation_type="qam", # or "pam" or "custom"
    num_bits_per_symbol=4,    # Example for QAM16
    constellation=constellation, # Include only if using "custom"
    hard_out=False,             # Set to False for log-probabilities, True for hard decisions
    dtype=tf.complex64          # Data type of received symbols
)

# Prepare the input tensors
# Assuming `y`, `prior`, and `no` have been defined earlier with correct shapes and types
# y = tf.constant([...], dtype=tf.complex64)
# prior = tf.constant([...], dtype=tf.float32)
# no = tf.constant([...], dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform demapping to get log-probabilities
log_probs = demapper((y, prior, no))

# Output log_probs contains the normalized log-probabilities of constellation points
```

After execution, the variable `log_probs` will contain the log-probabilities for each constellation point for every symbol in the batch. You must ensure that the input `y`, `prior`, and `no` tensors are correctly formatted and of the correct types (`tf.complex` for `y` and `tf.float` for `prior` and `no`).

Please adjust the specifics of the code snippet according to your use case (like using a different constellation type or having different shapes for input tensors).

Note that the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is flagged as deprecated, and you should consider using the `SymbolDemapper` class instead if you are using a newer version of Sionna that includes its functionality.

INSTRUCTION: Explain the difference between "app" and "maxlog" methods when using `SymbolLogits2LLRs` in Sionna.
ANSWER:In the context of using `SymbolLogits2LLRs` in Sionna, the "app" and "maxlog" methods refer to two different approaches for computing log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from unnormalized log-probabilities (logits) on constellation points.

1. **The "app" Method (A Posteriori Probability):**
   The "app" method computes the LLR for each bit based on the a posteriori probability which takes into account the probability of each constellation point given the received symbol and any prior knowledge of the bits. The LLR computation using the "app" method is more exact but computationally more intensive. It sums over all the constellation points where a given bit is 1 and compares it against the sum of all the constellation points where the bit is 0. This is expressed mathematically as:

   $$
   LLR(i) = \ln\left(\frac{
       \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_{i,1}} \Pr\left(c \vert \mathbf{p}\right) e^{z_c}
       }{
       \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}_{i,0}} \Pr\left(c \vert \mathbf{p}\right) e^{z_c}
       }\right)
   $$

   - $\mathcal{C}_{i,1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{i,0}$ represent the sets of constellation points where the $i$-th bit is 1 or 0, respectively.
   - $z_c$ represents the logit corresponding to the constellation point $c$.
   - $\Pr(c \vert \mathbf{p})$ is the prior probability of the constellation symbol $c$.

2. **The "maxlog" Method (Maximum A Posteriori Logarithm):**
   The "maxlog" method is an approximation of the "app" method that simplifies the computation. Instead of summing over all constellation points, it finds the maximum a posteriori probability for the points where a given bit is 1 and compares it to the maximum for the points where the bit is 0. The "maxlog" method is computationally simpler and is frequently used in practice due to its lower complexity. It is represented mathematically by:

   $$
   LLR(i) \approx \ln\left(\frac{
       \max_{c \in \mathcal{C}_{i,1}} \Pr\left(c \vert \mathbf{p}\right) e^{z_c}
       }{
       \max_{c \in \mathcal{C}_{i,0}} \Pr\left(c \vert \mathbf{p}\right) e^{z_c}
       }\right)
   $$

In summary, the "app" method provides more accurate LLRs by accounting for all constellation points, while the "maxlog" method offers an approximation that is less computationally demanding. The choice between these methods is often a trade-off between computational complexity and performance accuracy in demodulating the received symbols into their corresponding bits.

INSTRUCTION: Break down the process of calculating LLRs from logits using the "app" method in Sionna.
ANSWER:To calculate Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) from logits using the "app" method in the Sionna mapping module, we will follow a process based on the `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class provided in the API. The "app" method refers to the "a posteriori probability" computation. Here is the breakdown of the process given the context provided:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Firstly, an instance of the `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class needs to be created. You should specify that the method is "app" (a posteriori probability), and provide the number of bits per symbol in the modulation scheme being used.
   - For example, `SymbolLogits2LLRs(method="app", num_bits_per_symbol=4)` creates an LLR calculator for QAM16 (which has 4 bits per symbol) using the "app" method.

2. **Input Preparation**:
   - Prepare your logits, which are the unnormalized log probabilities from the received symbols after demapping. Your logits should be organized in a tensor format `[..., n, num_points]`, where `n` is the number of symbols and `num_points` is the number of possible constellation points.
   - If prior knowledge (`prior`) is available as LLRs for bits, it should be fed into the class as well. This must be in the shape of `[num_bits_per_symbol]` or `[..., n, num_bits_per_symbol]`.

3. **LLR Computation**:
   - Using the "app" method, the class will compute the LLR for each bit. For the ith bit, the computation will be done using the following equation:

     \[
     LLR(i) = \ln\left(\frac{\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{i,1}} \Pr(c|\mathbf{p}) e^{z_c}}{\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}_{i,0}} \Pr(c|\mathbf{p}) e^{z_c}}\right)
     \]

     where $\mathcal{C}_{i,1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{i,0}$ are sets of constellation points for which the ith bit is equal to 1 and 0, respectively. $\mathbf{z}$ is the vector of logits, and $\mathbf{p}$ is the vector of prior LLRs for the bits.

4. **Prior Probability Computation**:
   - The prior probability of a constellation symbol $c$, given the prior information $\mathbf{p}$, is computed as:

     \[
     \Pr(c|\mathbf{p}) = \prod_{k=0}^{K-1} \Pr(b_k = \ell(c)_k |\mathbf{p}) = \prod_{k=0}^{K-1} \text{sigmoid}(p_k \ell(c)_k)
     \]

     where $\ell(c)_k$ represents the kth bit label of constellation point $c$, with 0 being replaced by -1.

5. **Output**:
   - The output will be a tensor of shape `[..., n, num_bits_per_symbol]` representing the LLRs for every bit.
   - If `hard_out` is set to `True` during the initialization step, instead of LLRs, the method will return hard decisions on the bits.

In summary, the process is primarily about setting up the appropriate `SymbolLogits2LLRs` instance with the "app" method and inputting the logits, and if available, the prior LLRs. The actual computation is handled by the underlying Sionna framework, providing the desired LLRs based on the specified demapping approach.

INSTRUCTION: Identify the inputs required by `LLRs2SymbolLogits`, and describe its primary function in Sionna's mapping module.
ANSWER:`LLRs2SymbolLogits` is a class within Sionna's mapping module. The primary function of this class is to compute logits (i.e., unnormalized log-probabilities) or hard decisions on constellation points from a given tensor of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) on bits.

Required Input:
- **llrs**: A tensor of shape `[..., n, num_bits_per_symbol]` of type `tf.float`. This tensor contains the LLRs for every bit involved in the mapping process.

Parameters:
- **num_bits_per_symbol** (`int`): This parameter specifies the number of bits per constellation symbol, such as 4 for QAM16.
- **hard_out** (`bool`): A flag to determine the output type. If `True`, the layer provides hard-decided constellation points instead of soft-values. The default value is `False`.
- **dtype** (`tf.DType`): This parameter specifies the data type for the input and output. The options for the datatype are typically `tf.float32` or `tf.float64`, with the default being `tf.float32`.

Output:
- The output will be a tensor of logits of shape `[..., n, num_points]` if `hard_out` is `False`. If `hard_out` is `True`, the output will be a tensor of hard decisions on constellation points with shape `[..., n]`, and its type will be `tf.int32`.

The logits for each constellation point `c` are computed based on a formula involving the LLRs and bit labels (ell(c)_k) associated with that constellation point, where 0 is replaced by -1. The specific formula is not provided here based on the provided context, but it would typically involve converting the LLRs to probabilities and then to logits (log-probabilities) for each constellation point.

INSTRUCTION: Delineate the steps to compute logits on constellation points from a tensor of LLRs in Sionna.
ANSWER:To compute logits on constellation points from a tensor of LLRs in Sionna, you can follow these steps:

1. **Instantiate LLRs2SymbolLogits Object:**
   Create an instance of the `LLRs2SymbolLogits` class in Sionna. To do this, you need to specify the number of bits per symbol, which corresponds to the modulation scheme you are using. For example, with QAM16, there are 4 bits per symbol.

   ```python
   from sionna.mapping import LLRs2SymbolLogits

   # Instantiate LLRs2SymbolLogits with the appropriate number of bits per symbol
   num_bits_per_symbol = 4 # Example for QAM16
   llrs_to_logits = LLRs2SymbolLogits(num_bits_per_symbol=num_bits_per_symbol)
   ```

2. **Prepare the LLRs:**
   Make sure your tensor of LLRs is in the correct shape expected by the `LLRs2SymbolLogits` instance. The input should be a tensor of shape `[..., n, num_bits_per_symbol]`, where `n` is the number of received symbols, and each entry should be the LLR corresponding to a bit.

3. **Compute the Logits:**
   Use the instance of `LLRs2SymbolLogits` you created to compute the logits on constellation points. Pass the LLRs tensor to the `__call__` method of the `llrs_to_logits` instance.

   ```python
   # Assuming `llrs` is your tensor of LLRs
   logits = llrs_to_logits(llrs)
   ```

   The result stored in `logits` is a tensor with shape `[..., n, num_points]`, where `num_points` is the number of constellation points, which corresponds to `2**num_bits_per_symbol`. Each entry in this tensor is the logit for a corresponding constellation point.

4. **Use the Logits:**
   The output logits may be used as inputs to other parts of your communications system model that require unnormalized log-probabilities (for example, a soft-decision decoder).

Remember that proper logits are unnormalized log-probabilities, meaning they have not been passed through a softmax function to convert them into probabilities. If you need probabilities or normalized logits for subsequent steps, you may need to softmax the logits.

Please note that this explanation assumes familiarity with the constellation mapping schemes and how LLRs relate to them. If the context provided is complete, the steps outlined should enable you to compute logits on constellation points from a tensor of LLRs using the Sionna library.

INSTRUCTION: Discuss how `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` differs from `SymbolLogits2LLRs` and the reason for its deprecation in Sionna.
ANSWER:The `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` class in Sionna was originally used to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) or make hard decisions on bits from a tensor of logits (unnormalized log-probabilities) on constellation points, with the consideration that prior knowledge on the bits is available. The deprecation of `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` indicates that its functionality has been integrated into the more general `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class.

The main difference between `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` and `SymbolLogits2LLRs` was that the former explicitly handled the case where prior knowledge in the form of a tensor of LLRs for each bit was available and had to be combined with the logits of the received signals in order to calculate the posterior LLRs. This prior information altered the way that LLRs were computed, which was not handled by the original `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class.

The reason for integrating the functionality of `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` into `SymbolLogits2LLRs` likely stems from a desire to simplify the API and avoid redundancy. By including a `with_prior` flag in the `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class, which can be set to `True` if prior knowledge is available, Sionna's developers could present a single, unified interface for computing LLRs whether or not prior knowledge is available.

This integration also helps in maintaining the codebase by eliminating the need to keep parallel implementations for similar functionality updated and tested over time. Users who were using `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` will have to switch to using `SymbolLogits2LLRs` with the `with_prior` flag after its deprecation. 

From the given context, the detailed explanation of how to compute LLRs with prior knowledge, as well as the necessary parameters and methods (`"app"` and `"maxlog"`), are explained in the documentation section related to `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior`. These methods and parameters are also used in the integrated `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class, making it versatile and capable of handling the cases which `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` was initially designed for.

INSTRUCTION: Elaborate on the role of priors when computing LLRs in Sionna, particularly with regards to the `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` class.
ANSWER:The computation of Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) is a critical function in the decoding process of communication systems, especially within the context of error correction coding. LLRs provide a quantitative measure of the likelihood that a received symbol corresponds to a binary '1' or '0'. In systems such as those that might be modeled and simulated using Sionna, which is an open-source deep learning library for communication systems, prior information can be used to improve the accuracy of this computation. 

Within the Sionna library, one of the key classes for demapping and computing LLRs from constellation symbols is `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior`. From the provided context, it appears that this class takes into account prior information—probabilistic knowledge about the transmitted bits—when computing the LLRs. This prior knowledge is represented in the form of logits, which are essentially the log-probabilities corresponding to the likelihood of bits being '0' or '1'.

Priors play an essential role in the LLR computation since they act as an additional source of information that can adjust the final LLR values. When the receiver has certain expectations or knowledge about the transmitted bits, this information can be incorporated as priors to bias the demapping process in favor of more likely symbol decisions.

In the specific case of the `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` class, it utilizes the priors along with a method (either "app" or "maxlog") to compute the LLRs. This method determines how the LLRs are calculated from the logits and priors:

- With the “app” (a posteriori probability) method, the LLR for a specific bit is computed using the formula that takes into account the sum over a subset of constellation points that correspond to the bit being '1' and '0', respectively, weighted by the exponential of the logit values and priors.
- With the "maxlog" method, the calculation is approximated using the maximum value within these subsets.

The logits represent the log-probabilities (unnormalized) of the received constellation points, while the priors are given as LLRs for individual bits. The computation essentially updates the beliefs about the transmitted symbols (constellation points) by taking into account these priors, resulting in a more informed LLR.

It is important to note from the context that the `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` class has been deprecated, and its functionality integrated into the `SymbolLogits2LLRs` class, which now handles the computation of LLRs with or without available priors on the bits.

To conclude, the role of priors in the `SymbolLogits2LLRsWithPrior` class in Sionna was to enhance LLR computations by incorporating pre-existing probabilistic beliefs about the transmitted bits. This would allow the system to have a more refined and potentially accurate demapping from the received symbols to the LLRs used in further decoding processes.

INSTRUCTION: Clarify how the LLR is defined differently in Sionna compared to many textbooks in communication theory.
ANSWER:In Sionna, the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) is defined in a way that is equivalent to logits, which is different from the definition commonly found in many communication theory textbooks.

In many textbooks, the LLR for the \(i^{th}\) bit is given by:

\[ LLR(i) = \ln\left(\frac{\Pr\left(b_i=0 \mid y\right)}{\Pr\left(b_i=1 \mid y\right)}\right) \]

However, in Sionna, the LLR is defined as:

\[ LLR(i) = \ln\left(\frac{\Pr\left(b_i=1 \mid \mathbf{z},\mathbf{p}\right)}{\Pr\left(b_i=0 \mid \mathbf{z},\mathbf{p}\right)}\right) \]

Here, \( \mathbf{z} \) represents the logits on the constellation points, and \( \mathbf{p} = \left[p_0,\dots,p_{K-1}\right] \) represents the vector of LLRs that serve as prior knowledge on the \( K \) bits mapped to a constellation point. The choice to define LLR in a manner consistent with logits makes the implementation in Sionna explicitly consider the sign and the ratio of probabilities for the case where the bit is 1 versus the case where the bit is 0.

This difference in definition influences how LLRs are computed and interpreted when working with demapping and decoding functions within the Sionna library.

INSTRUCTION: Contrast the output results when the `hard_out` parameter is set to `True` or `False` in mapping-related classes of Sionna.
ANSWER:In Sionna, the `hard_out` parameter found in mapping-related classes like `SymbolDemapperWithPrior`, `SymbolLogits2LLRs`, and `LLRs2SymbolLogits` determines the type of output that is provided after processing the input data. Let's explore the differences in output when `hard_out` is set to `True` and when it's set to `False`.

When `hard_out` is set to `True`:
- The functions or classes that make use of this parameter will return hard-decided values based on the input data. This is the equivalent of making a definitive decision on each mapped symbol or bit—sort of a black-and-white perspective without nuances.
- For symbol demappers (`SymbolDemapperWithPrior`), this means that the output will be a tensor with hard decisions on the individual symbols, with a shape of `[..., n]`.
- For the `SymbolLogits2LLRs` and `LLRs2SymbolLogits` utility functions, setting `hard_out` to `True` results in hard-decided bits or constellation points, rather than probabilities or logits, which represent soft information.

When `hard_out` is set to `False`:
- The output is a set of soft-values, typically in the form of logits or log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), which provide information on the probability or likelihood of each symbol or bit being a certain value. This output contains more nuanced information than just hard decisions.
- In the case of `SymbolDemapperWithPrior`, the output will be a tensor with logits for every constellation point, with a shape of `[..., n, num_points]`, indicating the probability-like scores for each possible symbol at each position in the sequence.
- For `SymbolLogits2LLRs` and `LLRs2SymbolLogits`, when `hard_out` is set to `False`, the output will be LLRs or logits, respectively, containing soft information about the probable values of bits or constellation points.

In summary, when `hard_out` is `True`, the output is binary or hard-decided values, which can be used in applications where a strict decision is needed without probabilistic nuances. On the other hand, when `hard_out` is `False`, the output retains soft information in the form of probabilities or likelihoods, which can be used in further processing stages that benefit from probabilistic information, such as error correction algorithms.
