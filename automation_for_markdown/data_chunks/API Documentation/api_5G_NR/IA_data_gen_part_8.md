INSTRUCTION: Explain the purpose of the "sionna" Python package with a focus on 5G NR simulations.
ANSWER:The "sionna" Python package serves a specific purpose in the field of wireless communications, focusing on the simulation of 5G New Radio (NR) systems. Its primary role is to offer a set of tools and layers that support simulations compliant with 5G NR standards, catering especially to the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). This allows researchers, engineers, and developers to conduct accurate and standard-compliant simulations for various aspects of the 5G NR physical layer.

The PUSCH is a crucial component of the uplink communication in 5G, where "uplink" refers to the transmission of data from mobile devices to the base station. Simulating the behavior of the PUSCH is key to understanding and optimizing the overall performance of 5G networks, including aspects such as system throughput, reliability, and latency.

The sionna package includes a subset of functionalities as defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications. These specifications provide guidelines for implementing the physical layer of 5G communication systems and include documents like 3GPP TS 38.211, 3GPP TS 38.212, and 3GPP TS 38.214. These documents cover various elements such as physical channels and modulation (38.211), multiplexing and channel coding (38.212), and physical layer procedures for data (38.214).

In practical terms, the sionna package encapsulates complex processes such as modulation, coding, and transmission over a variety of channels into high-level abstractions like `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver`. These abstractions facilitate the simulation process, making it more accessible and modifiable according to the user's needs.

For instance, in a typical use case, one can simulate the transmission and reception of data over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The process would include generating a transmit signal and its corresponding information bits using a `PUSCHTransmitter`, modeling the channel effects with an `AWGN` channel instance, and then receiving and attempting to recover the original information bits with a `PUSCHReceiver`. Finally, users can calculate the bit error rate (BER) to evaluate the performance of the communication system under the given conditions.

The ability to select the proper modulation and coding scheme (MCS) is also implemented in sionna, enabling the simulation to reflect different levels of robustness and efficiency in data transmission as per 3GPP TS 38.214. This is important for adapting to varying channel conditions, such as changes in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Overall, the "sionna" Python package provides a powerful and flexible means for simulating 5G NR PUSCH communications, which is essential for developing and testing new technologies and protocols in the ever-evolving landscape of wireless communication.

INSTRUCTION: Describe the steps necessary to perform a standard-compliant simulation of the 5G NR PUSCH using Sionna based on the provided code snippet.
ANSWER:To perform a standard-compliant simulation of the 5G NR PUSCH using Sionna based on the provided code snippet, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Make sure you have Sionna installed in your Python environment. This package is necessary to perform the 5G NR simulations using the provided code snippets.

2. **Create a PUSCH Configuration**:
   Instantiate a `PUSCHConfig` object with default settings to hold the configuration parameters for the PUSCH.
   
   ```python
   pusch_config = PUSCHConfig()
   ```

3. **Instantiate PUSCH Transmitter**:
   With the `PUSCHConfig` object, create a `PUSCHTransmitter`. This object will handle the transmission logic of the PUSCH according to the configurations specified.
   
   ```python
   pusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)
   ```

4. **Create PUSCH Receiver**:
   Instantiate a `PUSCHReceiver` using the previously created `PUSCHTransmitter`. The receiver will process the received signal and attempt to recover the transmitted information.
   
   ```python
   pusch_receiver = PUSCHReceiver(pusch_transmitter)
   ```

5. **Simulate the Transmission Channel**:
   Create an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel instance which will introduce noise into the transmission, mimicking real-world conditions.
   
   ```python
   channel = AWGN()
   ```

6. **Simulate Transmissions**:
   Define `batch_size` to represent the number of transmission instances you want to simulate in one go. Also, specify the noise variance `no`. Then, use the `PUSCHTransmitter` to generate the transmit signal `x` and the information bits `b`.
   
   ```python
   batch_size = 16
   no = 0.1  # Noise variance
   x, b = pusch_transmitter(batch_size)  # Generate transmit signal and info bits
   ```

7. **Simulate Channel Output**:
   Pass the generated transmit signal `x` and the noise variance `no` through the channel to obtain the simulated channel output `y`.
   
   ```python
   y = channel([x, no])  # Simulate channel output
   ```

8. **Recover the Information Bits**:
   Input the channel output `y` and noise variance `no` into the `PUSCHReceiver` to estimate the information bits `b_hat`.
   
   ```python
   b_hat = pusch_receiver([y, no])  # Recover the info bits
   ```

9. **Compute Bit Error Rate (BER)**:
   With the original information bits `b` and the estimated bits `b_hat`, compute the BER to evaluate the performance of the transmission. Finally, output the BER results.
   
   ```python
   print("BER:", compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy())
   ```

By following these steps in sequence, you perform a standard-compliant simulation of the 5G NR PUSCH using the high-level abstractions provided by Sionna. Ensure that `PUSCHConfig`, `PUSCHTransmitter`, and `PUSCHReceiver` are correctly imported from Sionna before running the simulation. This exercise allows you to simulate the physical uplink shared channel considering noise through an AWGN channel model and determine the effectiveness of the transmission by calculating the BER.

INSTRUCTION: Detail the process of creating a `PUSCHConfig` object with default settings in Sionna.
ANSWER:To create a `PUSCHConfig` object with default settings in Sionna, follow this process:

1. Ensure you have Sionna installed and properly set up in your working environment. Sionna is a Python library, so you'd typically use pip to install it with a command like `pip install sionna`.

2. Import the necessary class from Sionna. In this case, you need to import `PUSCHConfig` from the library to be able to create an instance of it with the default settings:

   ```python
   from sionna.nr import PUSCHConfig
   ```

3. Once the `PUSCHConfig` class has been imported, instantiate an object of this class without passing any arguments to the constructor to use the default configuration settings:

   ```python
   pusch_config = PUSCHConfig()
   ```

This line of code will create a `PUSCHConfig` object with the default parameters as defined by the Sionna library, which aligns with the 3GPP specifications for the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) used in 5G NR communications.

The created object can then be used to configure or simulate the PUSCH with other components in Sionna, such as a `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver`, as part of a simulation pipeline or specific use-case scenario. The default settings that come with the instantiated `PUSCHConfig` should work for most standard 5G NR PUSCH simulations unless specific customization is required for research or testing purposes.

INSTRUCTION: Explain the instantiation of a `PUSCHTransmitter` from `PUSCHConfig`.
ANSWER:To instantiate a `PUSCHTransmitter` object from a `PUSCHConfig` instance in the context of 5G NR simulations, you first need to create a `PUSCHConfig` object with the desired configuration settings. The `PUSCHConfig` class likely encapsulates various parameters and settings that define how the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) operates according to the 3GPP specifications for 5G New Radio (NR).

Here is the essential Python code that demonstrates the instantiation process:

```python
# Create a PUSCH configuration with default settings
pusch_config = PUSCHConfig()

# Instantiate a PUSCHTransmitter from the PUSCHConfig
pusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)
```

In this example:

1. `pusch_config = PUSCHConfig()` creates a new `PUSCHConfig` object with default settings. This object holds the configuration for the PUSCH, which might include parameters like modulation scheme, coding rates, and resource allocation settings.

2. `pusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)` creates a new `PUSCHTransmitter` object using the previously defined `PUSCHConfig` object. The `PUSCHTransmitter` will use these settings to simulate the transmission of data over the PUSCH.

The `PUSCHTransmitter` object represents a high-level abstraction of the functionality required to encode and modulate data for transmission on the PUSCH according to the standards defined in the relevant 3GPP specifications. This abstraction likely includes methods to perform channel coding, modulation, and possibly other physical layer processing tasks necessary to prepare data for transmission over the air interface.

INSTRUCTION: Clarify how to create a `PUSCHReceiver` using the `PUSCHTransmitter` object.
ANSWER:To create a `PUSCHReceiver` in the context of simulating the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) in 5G New Radio (NR) communications, you need to first instantiate a `PUSCHTransmitter` object. The `PUSCHReceiver` can then be created by passing the `PUSCHTransmitter` object to it. The transmitter object carries the configuration settings which the receiver needs to decode the transmitted signals properly.

Here's how you can create a `PUSCHReceiver` using a `PUSCHTransmitter` object:

1. Initialise a PUSCH configuration object with all the necessary settings, which may include the modulation scheme, coding rate, and so on.
   
2. Create a `PUSCHTransmitter` object by passing the PUSCH configuration object to it.

3. Create a `PUSCHReceiver` by passing the previously created `PUSCHTransmitter` object to it.

This is how you can do it in code, based on the provided context:

First, initialize the PUSCH configuration with default settings:

```python
pusch_config = PUSCHConfig()
```

Next, create the `PUSCHTransmitter`:

```python
pusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)
```

Then, with the `PUSCHTransmitter` object ready, create the `PUSCHReceiver`:

```python
pusch_receiver = PUSCHReceiver(pusch_transmitter)
```

This newly created `PUSCHReceiver` will now be ready to receive signals that were transmitted using the `PUSCHTransmitter` object, allowing you to simulate the transmission and reception process within your 5G NR PUSCH environment. The accurate simulation of the PUSCH assumes that other components of the system, such as the channel model and noise variance, are also properly defined and instantiated as needed for your specific simulation needs.

INSTRUCTION: Illustrate how to simulate transmissions over an AWGN channel within the Sionna package.
ANSWER:Simulating transmissions over an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel within the Sionna package involves several steps. These steps can be generally categorized as setting up the transmitter, the receiver, the channel, generating the transmit signal, feeding the signal through the channel, and finally processing the received signal to recover the transmitted information.

Here, I will guide you through a simplified process of simulating the 5G NR physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) over an AWGN channel using Sionna. The code snippets included are based on the context provided and are necessary to illustrate the process.

First, you need to set up the PUSCH configuration and instantiate the transmitter and receiver:

```python
# Create a PUSCH configuration with default settings
pusch_config = PUSCHConfig()

# Instantiate a PUSCHTransmitter from the PUSCHConfig
pusch_transmitter = PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)

# Create a PUSCHReceiver using the PUSCHTransmitter
pusch_receiver = PUSCHReceiver(pusch_transmitter)
```

Next, you create an instance of an AWGN channel:

```python
# AWGN channel
channel = AWGN()
```

You will then need to specify a batch size for the number of transmissions you wish to simulate and set the noise variance (denoted as `no` in the code), which characterizes the AWGN channel's noise level:

```python
# Simulate transmissions over the AWGN channel
batch_size = 16
no = 0.1 # Noise variance
```

After setting up the channel, use the transmitter to generate a batch of transmit signals and corresponding information bits:

```python
x, b = pusch_transmitter(batch_size) # Generate transmit signal and info bits
```

Simulate the passage of the transmit signal through the AWGN channel, which adds white Gaussian noise to the signal:

```python
y = channel([x, no]) # Simulate channel output
```

Once the signal has passed through the channel, use the receiver to process the channel output and attempt to recover the information bits:

```python
b_hat = pusch_receiver([x, no]) # Recover the info bits
```

Finally, you can calculate and print the Bit Error Rate (BER) to evaluate the performance of the transmission over the AWGN channel:

```python
# Compute BER
print("BER:", compute_ber(b, b_hat).numpy())
```

This gives you a simple example of how to simulate transmissions over an AWGN channel using the Sionna package. The `compute_ber` function (not detailed in the context provided) would typically be a utility provided by Sionna to calculate the BER between the original and recovered information bits.

For more detailed simulations or customization, you would need to explore the Sionna package documentation, tune the transmitter and receiver configurations, modify the noise variance, or implement additional channel effects and signal processing techniques.

INSTRUCTION: Outline the steps to compute the bit error rate (BER) after simulating channel output and recovering information bits.
ANSWER:To compute the bit error rate (BER) after simulating channel output and recovering information bits in the context of simulating a 5G NR PUSCH, follow these steps:

1. **Create a PUSCH Configuration**:
   Begin by defining a PUSCH configuration using the `PUSCHConfig` class which provides the default settings for the simulation.

2. **Instantiate a PUSCH Transmitter**:
   With the PUSCH configuration settings, create a transmitter instance using `PUSCHTransmitter(pusch_config)`. This transmitter will handle the generation of the modulated signal according to the 5G NR standard.

3. **Create a PUSCH Receiver**:
   Similarly, create a PUSCH receiver instance that can demodulate the signal and recover the information bits. The receiver is designed using `PUSCHReceiver(pusch_transmitter)` which utilizes the configuration from the previously instantiated transmitter.

4. **Set Up the Channel**:
   Define the channel model that will be used in the simulation. For this exercise, use an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel by creating an instance of it with `AWGN()`.

5. **Simulate Transmission**:
   You need to determine the batch size for the simulation, which is the number of transmissions, and set the noise variance (`no`) for the channel. Use the transmitter to generate the transmit signal `x` and the corresponding set of information bits `b` with `x, b = pusch_transmitter(batch_size)`.

6. **Simulate the Channel Output**:
   Pass the transmitted signal `x` through the channel using the noise variance parameter `no`, with a form like `y = channel([x, no])`. This simulates the impact of the channel on the transmitted signal and generates the received signal `y`.

7. **Recover the Information Bits**:
   Use the receiver to demodulate the received signal `y` and estimate the transmitted information bits `b_hat` using a method resembling `b_hat = pusch_receiver([y, no])`.

8. **Compute the Bit Error Rate (BER)**:
   To calculate the BER, you compare the original transmitted bits `b` with the estimated bits `b_hat`. This is usually done with a function like `compute_ber(b, b_hat)`. In a Python code context, this could be illustrated as follows:

   ```python
   ber = compute_ber(b, b_hat)
   print("BER:", ber.numpy())
   ```

This function computes the ratio of the number of incorrect bits to the total number of transmitted bits to assess the performance of the transmission scheme under the simulated channel conditions. The result is then printed out or returned for further analysis.

The process above outlines the general steps required for calculating BER in the context of a 5G NR PUSCH simulation, using standard-compliant components provided by a simulation framework such as Sionna.

INSTRUCTION: Discuss the high-level abstractions provided by `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver` in Sionna, and how they can be modified.
ANSWER:The `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver` in Sionna provide high-level abstractions for simulating the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) as specified in the 3GPP standards for 5G New Radio (NR). These abstractions encapsulate the necessary processing blocks required for transmitting and receiving signals over the PUSCH in a 5G NR system.

The `PUSCHTransmitter` abstraction covers the creation of the PUSCH configuration and the instantiation of a PUSCH transmitter based on that configuration. It manages the encoding of information bits, modulation, and any other signal processing required for preparing a signal for transmission according to the configured parameters. Generating a transmit signal and corresponding information bits can be done easily by calling the instantiated `pusch_transmitter` with a specified batch size.

The `PUSCHReceiver`, on the other hand, handles the reception process. It takes the transmitted signal (possibly after it has passed through a channel, like an AWGN channel in the provided code context) and the noise variance, demodulates and decodes the signal, and attempts to recover the original information bits that were sent by the transmitter.

These abstractions can be modified depending on the simulation requirements. For instance, you can adjust configurations such as the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to evaluate system performance under different conditions. The provided code snippet shows the creation of a `PUSCHConfig` object with default settings, but you can modify its parameters before passing it to the `PUSCHTransmitter`. Through this process, simulations can adhere to or deviate from standard-compliant scenarios, thereby providing flexibility in exploring different aspects of the PUSCH's performance.

For example, the MCS can be chosen using the `select_mcs` function by supplying an appropriate MCS index and optional parameters, such as `table_index` or `channel_type`. The chosen MCS will affect the modulation order and coding rate that the transmitter uses, which will, in turn, impact the transmitter's output.

In summary, `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver` in Sionna abstract the complexity of 5G NR PUSCH signal processing, allowing users to quickly set up and modify simulations to assess different configurations and channel conditions. Adjustments can be made to the PUSCH configuration, such as the MCS, to tailor the simulation for specific research questions or system evaluations. The abstraction level provided makes Sionna a powerful tool for researchers and engineers working on communication systems simulation.

INSTRUCTION: Utilize the `select_mcs` function to select a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for the PUSCH channel, including setting all parameters to their defaults and explaining each parameter's purpose.
ANSWER:To select a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) for the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) using the `select_mcs` function while setting all parameters to their defaults, you can call the function without specifying any arguments except the mandatory `mcs_index`. According to the given context, the default values for each parameter serve the following purposes:

1. **mcs_index**: This is a mandatory parameter that specifies the MCS index, which ranges from 0 to 28. This index directly relates to a predefined combination of modulation type and coding rate as defined in the 3GPP TS 38.214 standard. The exact modulation and code rate that corresponds to a particular MCS index is detailed in the standard.

2. **table_index**: Set to 1 by default, this parameter indicates which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 standard is used. There are multiple tables defined in the standard that cater to different channel conditions and requirements.

3. **channel_type**: Set to 'PUSCH' by default, this parameter specifies the type of 5G NR physical channel. Since we're interested in the PUSCH, this is appropriate and does not need to change.

4. **transform_precoding**: Set to `False` by default, this indicates whether transform precoding is applied. Transform precoding is a specific method of signal processing used for the PUSCH under certain conditions. 

5. **pi2bpsk**: Also set to `False` by default, this parameter applies the higher-layer parameter `tp-pi2BPSK`. It's a modulation scheme used in particular scenarios for PUSCH. 

6. **verbose**: Set to `False` by default, this controls the verbosity of the function output. If set to `True`, the function will print additional information which might be helpful for debugging or learning more about the function's internal process.

The function returns a tuple containing the `modulation_order` and `target_rate`, where `modulation_order` indicates the number of bits per modulation symbol, and `target_rate` specifies the target code rate for the selected MCS.

To call `select_mcs`, given an MCS index of say 10, you would do the following in Python:

```python
modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index=10)
```

Not specifying the optional parameters implies that their default values are used. In this example, any additional details or specific characteristics of the modulation and coding scheme selected using the MCS index would depend on the definitions provided in the referenced standard, which in this domain would be the 3GPP TS 38.214.

INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate the selection of an MCS for the PDSCH channel in Sionna, revealing the impact of different `table_index` values.
ANSWER:To demonstrate the selection of an MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) for the PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) in Sionna, we will use the `select_mcs` function from Sionna's NR (New Radio) utils module. The `table_index` parameter in this function specifies which MCS table from the 3GPP TS 38.214 specification to use. Different values for `table_index` will result in different MCS selections according to the specified tables.

Here's an example demonstrating how the `table_index` affects the selection of MCS for the PDSCH channel:

```python
from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs

# Example MCS index to demonstrate the impact of table_index
mcs_index = 10 # This can be any value between 0 and 28 as per 3GPP TS 38.214

# Iterate over the possible table_index values and print the selected MCS for PDSCH
for table_index in [1, 2, 3, 4]: # Table index values as defined in the standard
    modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, 
                                               table_index=table_index, 
                                               channel_type='PDSCH')
    print(f"Table Index: {table_index}")
    print(f"Modulation Order (bits per symbol): {modulation_order}")
    print(f"Target Code Rate: {target_rate}")
    print("----------------------------------")
```

In the code above:

- The `select_mcs` function is called with different `table_index` values (1, 2, 3, 4) as specified in the 3GPP TS 38.214.
- The `mcs_index` is set to 10 as an example, but this could be any value from 0 to 28.
- The `channel_type` is set to `'PDSCH'` since we are interested in demonstrating this for the downlink shared channel.
- The `modulation_order` and `target_rate` are the outputs of the function, detailing the modulation order (which determines how many bits are sent per symbol) and the target code rate (the rate at which data is encoded), respectively.

By running the code snippet, you will see the differing modulation orders and target code rates resulting from the selection of different MCS tables, and thus observe the impact of the `table_index` on the MCS configuration for the PDSCH channel.

INSTRUCTION: Execute the `select_mcs` function with custom parameters, such as `transform_precoding` and `pi2bpsk`, and interpret the output tuple containing modulation order and target rate.
ANSWER:To execute the `select_mcs` function with custom parameters for `transform_precoding` and `pi2bpsk`, we first need to pass an `mcs_index` since it is a required parameter. The `select_mcs` function will return a tuple containing the modulation order and target rate based on these parameters and its application to PUSCH as indicated by the documentation.

The parameters `transform_precoding` and `pi2bpsk` are both Boolean and pertain to the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The first indicates whether MCS tables that apply transform precoding should be used, while the second indicates whether the higher-layer parameter `tp-pi2BPSK` is applied or not.

Let's assume we have chosen an `mcs_index` of 10 (you would replace this with a specific index based on your requirements). We want to enable both `transform_precoding` and `pi2bpsk`. The code snippet to execute the function with these parameters would look like:

```python
# Import necessary modules and functions
from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs

# Set the MCS index
mcs_index = 10

# Execute the function with custom parameters
modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(mcs_index, transform_precoding=True, pi2bpsk=True)

# Now, interpret the output
print(f"Modulation Order: {modulation_order}")
print(f"Target Rate: {target_rate}")
```

After executing the function with the given parameters, you would get the tuple `(modulation_order, target_rate)`. The `modulation_order` indicates the number of bits per symbol that the modulation scheme uses, and the `target_rate` indicates the code rate (portion of the transmitted bits that are not overhead for error correction).

For example, if the output of the function is `(4, 0.5)`, this means that with the given `mcs_index` and enabled `transform_precoding` and `pi2bpsk`, the selected modulation scheme uses 4 bits per symbol and the target code rate is 0.5, meaning that half of the transmitted bits are used for error correction while the other half carries actual user data.

INSTRUCTION: Provide an example of using the `verbose` parameter in `select_mcs` to print additional information during the MCS selection process.
ANSWER:To use the `verbose` parameter in `select_mcs` and print additional information during the MCS selection process, set the `verbose` parameter to `True` when calling the function. Here's an example:

```python
# Assume that select_mcs is imported from sionna.nr.utils
from sionna.nr.utils import select_mcs

# MCS index for which we want to select the MCS
mcs_index = 10  # Example index, can be any from 0 to 28

# Table index, e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4
table_index = 1

# Channel type, can be either "PUSCH" or "PDSCH"
channel_type = "PUSCH"

# Whether transform precoding is used or not
transform_precoding = False

# Whether pi/2-BPSK is used or not
pi2bpsk = False

# Set verbose to True to print additional information
verbose = True

# Call select_mcs with the verbose parameter set to True
modulation_order, target_rate = select_mcs(
    mcs_index,
    table_index=table_index,
    channel_type=channel_type,
    transform_precoding=transform_precoding,
    pi2bpsk=pi2bpsk,
    verbose=verbose
)

# The function will print additional information to the console during the MCS selection process
```

In this example, the `select_mcs` function is called with a specific `mcs_index`, and `verbose` is set to `True`. With `verbose` enabled, as the function executes, it will output extra details to the console concerning the MCS selection process, which can be useful for understanding the behavior of the function and for debugging purposes.

INSTRUCTION: Summarize the 3GPP specifications referenced by the Sionna package—3GPP TS 38.211, 38.212, and 38.214—and how they relate to Sionna’s implementation of 5G NR features.
ANSWER:The Sionna package implements features compliant with the 5G New Radio (NR) standard, specifically focusing on the physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). The implementation references a subset of the 3GPP specifications, i.e., TS 38.211, TS 38.212, and TS 38.214, which define various aspects of the 5G NR physical layer.

3GPP TS 38.211: Titled "NR; Physical channels and modulation," this specification outlines the physical channels' structures and associated modulation schemes used in 5G NR. It includes details on how data is carried through physical channels like PUSCH and the modulation techniques that ensure the data is effectively transmitted over the wireless medium. Sionna's package would leverage these specifications to define the signal processing aspects related to modulation and demodulation for data transmission and reception.

3GPP TS 38.212: Titled "NR; Multiplexing and channel coding," this specification covers the multiplexing and channel coding schemes for data and control information in 5G NR. It explains how information is formatted for transmission and how error correction coding is applied to protect communications from errors introduced by the noisy channel. Sionna uses this specification to implement the encoding and decoding processes necessary for processing the uplink shared channel data.

3GPP TS 38.214: Titled "NR; Physical layer procedures for data," TS 38.214 provides the procedures related to the physical layer data transmission, including modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection for PUSCH and the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), along with various other mechanisms for adaptive data rate control. Sionna’s package includes implementations of MCS tables for PUSCH that follow the guidelines in this specification.

Sionna’s implementation allows users to perform standard-compliant simulations of the 5G NR PUSCH with high-level abstractions such as `PUSCHTransmitter` and `PUSCHReceiver`, which encapsulate all required processing blocks. For example, the `select_mcs` function can be used to select an MCS index and apply different MCS tables from TS 38.214, which are critical to simulating realistic 5G NR scenarios.

In summary, Sionna implements key features of the 5G NR physical layer by adhering to the specifications and procedures outlined in the 3GPP technical specifications TS 38.211, TS 38.212, and TS 38.214, particularly focusing on the uplink shared channel and related signal processing tasks.
