### 1. INSTRUCTION:
Set up your programming environment to use Sionna by installing the package and configuring TensorFlow to use a specific GPU or CPU if multiple options are available.

**ANSWER:**

To set up your programming environment to use Sionna and configure TensorFlow to use a specific GPU or CPU, follow these steps:

1. **Install Sionna**:
   Check if Sionna is already installed using the try-except block provided in the context. If it's not installed, use pip to install it.

   ```python
   try:
       import sionna
   except ImportError as e:
       # if Sionna is not installed, it installs the package
       !pip install sionna
   ```

2. **Import packages**:
   Import other necessary packages such as `os`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, and `matplotlib`.

   ```python
   import os
   import numpy as np
   import tensorflow as tf
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

   Make sure that `%matplotlib inline` is used if working within a Jupyter notebook environment to display plots inline.

3. **Configure TensorFlow GPU/CPU usage**:
   Set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the index of the desired GPU. If you want to use CPU instead, set it to an empty string "".

   ```python
   gpu_num = 0 # index of the GPU you want to use; use "" for CPU
   os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_num)
   os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3' # optional, to limit TensorFlow warnings
   ```

4. **Check available GPUs**:
   Use the `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` function to list all available GPUs.

   ```python
   gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
   print('Number of GPUs available :', len(gpus))
   ```

5. **Configure TensorFlow to use a single GPU**:
   If there are multiple GPUs available, restrict TensorFlow to only use one, and set memory growth to `True` to allocate only as much memory as needed.

   ```python
   if gpus:
       gpu_num = 0 # specify the GPU index you want to use
       try:
           tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[gpu_num], 'GPU')
           tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[gpu_num], True)
           print('Using only GPU number', gpu_num)
       except RuntimeError as e:
           # this may happen if you have already created a TensorFlow session
           print(e)
   ```

6. **Testing environment**:
   After setting up the environment, it's generally a good practice to test if TensorFlow is able to access the designated GPU or CPU:

   ```python
   print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
   print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
   print("Is TensorFlow built with CUDA:", tf.test.is_built_with_cuda())
   print("List of available devices:")
   print(tf.config.list_physical_devices())
   ```

Now your environment should be set to use Sionna on the desired GPU or CPU. You can start simulating the link-level performance for wireless communication systems using the Sionna package with the assurance that TensorFlow is utilizing the correct hardware.

### 2. INSTRUCTION:
Write a script using Sionna to perform a basic simulation of PHY-layer link-level performance, including importing necessary libraries and suppressing TensorFlow warnings.

**ANSWER:**

```python
# ----------------------------
# Sionna PHY-layer Simulation
# ----------------------------

# Import necessary libraries
import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set environment variables
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"  # Set to "" to use CPU instead of GPU
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # Suppress TensorFlow warnings

# Configure TensorFlow to use a specific GPU and allocate memory as needed
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    gpu_num = 0  # Select which GPU to use if multiple are available
    tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[gpu_num], 'GPU')
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[gpu_num], True)

# Initialize the AWGN channel layer
channel = sionna.channel.AWGN()

# Define transmission parameters
batch_size = 1000  # Batch size for the simulation
ebno_db = 4  # Eb/N0 value in dB
k_ldpc = 250  # Number of information bits per LDPC codeword
n_ldpc = 500  # LDPC codeword length
num_bits_per_symbol = 4  # Number of bits per QAM symbol (e.g., 16-QAM)

# Calculate the noise variance based on Eb/N0
noise_variance = sionna.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, k_ldpc/n_ldpc)

# Initialize source, encoder, modulator, demapper, and decoder layers
binary_source = sionna.utils.BinarySource()
encoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.encoding.LDPC5GEncoder(k_ldpc, n_ldpc)
constellation = sionna.mapping.Constellation("qam", num_bits_per_symbol)
mapper = sionna.mapping.Mapper(constellation=constellation)
demapper = sionna.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)
decoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding.LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, cn_type="boxplus", num_iter=20)

# Run the simulation in eager mode
# Generate a batch of random bit vectors
b = binary_source([batch_size, k_ldpc])

# Encode the bits using 5G LDPC code
c = encoder(b)

# Map bits to constellation symbols
x = mapper(c)

# Transmit over an AWGN channel at specified Eb/N0
y = channel([x, noise_variance])

# Demap to LLRs (Log-Likelihood Ratios)
llr = demapper([y, noise_variance])

# LDPC decoding using BP algorithm
b_hat = decoder(llr)

# Evaluate performance metrics
ber_uncoded = sionna.utils.metrics.compute_ber(c, tf.cast(tf.less(0.0, llr), tf.float32))
ber_coded = sionna.utils.metrics.compute_ber(b, b_hat)

# Output results
print(f"BER uncoded = {ber_uncoded:.3f} at EbNo = {ebno_db} dB")
print(f"BER after decoding = {ber_coded:.3f} at EbNo = {ebno_db} dB")
print(f"In total {np.size(b.numpy())} bits were simulated")
```

Please note that in order to run this script, you need to have TensorFlow, NumPy, and the Sionna package installed in your environment. This script runs a basic simulation using Sionna for the physical layer (PHY) analysis, generating random bit vectors, encoding them using an LDPC 5G encoder, mapping them to a QAM constellation, adding AWGN noise, demapping to LLRs, and LDPC decoding to estimate the bit error rate (BER) of the uncoded and coded transmissions.

### 3. INSTRUCTION:
Initialize an AWGN channel layer in Sionna, and create a simple example to add Gaussian noise to an array of complex symbols, specifying the SNR in dB.

**ANSWER:**

Here's an example demonstrating how to initialize an AWGN channel layer in Sionna and add Gaussian noise to an array of complex symbols, specifying the SNR in dB.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna
import numpy as np

# Assuming Sionna and other dependencies are already installed

# Initialize AWGN channel layer
awgn_layer = sionna.channel.AWGN()

# Create an array of complex symbols (e.g., representing QPSK symbols)
# Here we use a batch size of 1, 8 symbols per batch
complex_symbols = tf.constant([[1+1j, -1+1j, 1-1j, -1-1j, 1+1j, -1+1j, 1-1j, -1-1j]], dtype=tf.complex64)

# Specify desired SNR in dB
snr_db = 10

# Calculate noise variance from SNR
noise_variance = sionna.utils.db_to_linear(-snr_db)

# Apply AWGN channel to complex symbols
# The second input to the AWGN layer is the noise variance
noisy_symbols = awgn_layer([complex_symbols, noise_variance])

# Print the original and noisy symbols
print("Original symbols:", complex_symbols.numpy())
print("Noisy symbols:", noisy_symbols.numpy())
```

Here we first define a Keras layer for an AWGN channel (`awgn_layer`) then create a TensorFlow constant representing an array of transmit symbols (`complex_symbols`). The SNR is specified in dB and converted to noise variance using the utility function `sionna.utils.db_to_linear()` provided in Sionna. Subsequently, the AWGN layer is applied to the complex symbols with the calculated noise variance, and the resulting noisy symbols are printed out.

The noise application is done through the layer call semantics, with the AWGN layer object `awgn_layer` being called with the symbols and noise variance as arguments. This is consistent with the TensorFlow and Keras API, where layers can be used as functions that perform the layer's operations when called.

### 4. INSTRUCTION:
Explain how batching works in Sionna by creating a batch of random bit sequences and simulating their passage through an AWGN channel.

**ANSWER:**

Batching in Sionna works by parallelizing the simulations so that each element in the batch dimension is simulated independently. This is analogous to running multiple independent simulations (or an outer for-loop in Matlab/NumPy) at the same time, with each simulation being one of the batch elements. The batch dimension is always the first dimension in a tensor.

To demonstrate how batching works in the context of transmitting random bit sequences through an AWGN channel, here are the steps that we would typically follow in Sionna:

1. Define the batch size and other parameters.
2. Create a batch of random bit sequences using a BinarySource layer.
3. Map these bits to modulation symbols using a Mapper layer and a predefined Constellation.
4. Define an AWGN channel layer.
5. Calculate the noise variance based on a given Eb/N0 (Energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) using utilities provided by Sionna.
6. Pass the modulation symbols and noise variance through the AWGN channel layer to simulate the effect of the channel.
7. Optionally, the noisy symbols can then be demodulated and decoded if simulating a full communication system.

Now, let's simulate the transmission of a batch of random bit sequences through an AWGN channel, step by step:

```python
# System parameters
batch_size = 100    # Number of independent frames in a batch
num_bits = 1000     # Number of bits per frame

# Step 1: Initialize a Binary Source
binary_source = sionna.utils.BinarySource()

# Step 2: Generate a batch of random bit sequences
random_bits = binary_source([batch_size, num_bits])

# Step 3: Map bits to symbols (assume BPSK for simplicity)
bpsk_constellation = sionna.mapping.Constellation("bpsk")
mapper = sionna.mapping.Mapper(bpsk_constellation)
mod_symbols = mapper(random_bits)

# Step 4: Initialize AWGN channel layer
awgn_channel = sionna.channel.AWGN()

# Step 5: Calculate the noise variance for a given Eb/N0 in dB
ebno_db = 10  # SNR value in dB
noise_variance = sionna.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol=1, coderate=1)

# Step 6: Simulate the passage of the modulation symbols through the AWGN channel
received_symbols = awgn_channel([mod_symbols, noise_variance])

# The 'received_symbols' now is a batch of noisy received symbols corresponding
# to each of the originally transmitted random bit sequences from 'random_bits'
```

You can then proceed with demapping and decoding if the simulation includes these stages. This code assumes that Sionna and TensorFlow have been appropriately installed and configured to run on a GPU or CPU, as shown in your context information.

### 5. INSTRUCTION:
Write a Sionna-based script to simulate transmitting codewords with an appended CRC-24 check, demonstrating parallel batch processing and tensor shaping.

**ANSWER:**

It seems you need a script that demonstrates the transmission of codewords appended with a CRC-24 check using the Sionna package for tensor-based parallel batch processing. Here's a simple example script to point you in the right direction.

The script creates a batch of random binary codewords, appends a CRC-24 checksum to each codeword, and demonstrates how to process it through a simulation pipeline designed for parallel execution. It uses eager execution for simplicity, but for large-scale simulations, you would typically compile this into a TensorFlow graph for improved performance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna
from sionna.utils import BinarySource
from sionna.fec.crc import CRCEncoder, CRCDecoder

# Assuming that Sionna is correctly installed and required GPUs are configured

# System parameters
batch_size = 100        # Number of batches for parallel simulation
num_codewords = 64      # Number of codewords per batch
info_bit_length = 500   # Number of information bits per codeword
crc_poly = "CRC24A"     # CRC polynomial

# Instantiate the source to generate random binary sequences
binary_source = BinarySource()

# Instantiate the CRC Encoder and Decoder with the given polynomial
crc_encoder = CRCEncoder(crc_poly)
crc_decoder = CRCDecoder(crc_encoder)

# Generate a batch of random binary codewords
binary_codewords = binary_source([batch_size, num_codewords, info_bit_length])
print("Shape of input codewords:", binary_codewords.shape)

# Append a CRC to the codewords
codewords_with_crc, _ = crc_encoder(binary_codewords)
codeword_shape = codewords_with_crc.shape[-1]  # Store the shape with CRC
print("Shape of codewords with CRC:", codewords_with_crc.shape)

# Simulate pipeline....
# For example, just a simple pass-through or dummy processing for now
# You would typically do more (e.g., channel encoding, modulation, channel, etc.)
processed_codewords = codewords_with_crc    # Replace with actual pipeline steps

# After processing (e.g., after receiving and decoding), check CRC.
# Here we just assume that processed_codewords are our received codewords.
u_hat, crc_valid = crc_decoder(processed_codewords)
print("Shape of decoded codewords:", u_hat.shape)
print("Shape of CRC validity tensor:", crc_valid.shape)
print("Valid CRC check for first codeword in the first batch:", crc_valid.numpy()[0, 0])

# You would typically proceed with BER computations, assessing CRC-validity, etc.
```

Remember that this script assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts of tensorflow and Sionna and have the necessary environment to execute it. If you need a complete pipeline simulation with all components (e.g., channel encoding, modulation, transmission, reception, demodulation, and decoding), you'll need to build upon this template and add each component following the Sionna examples and documentation.

### 6. INSTRUCTION:
Simulate multiple independent users in a communication link by adding an extra dimension to your data tensor, showing how Sionna handles multi-user environments.

**ANSWER:**

Based on the provided context, which includes an example of simulating link-level performance for a single user, adding the dimension to simulate multiple independent users in Sionna can be achieved with a few modifications. Here is an approach to add an extra dimension for multi-user simulations:

1. Adjust the `b` tensor to represent multiple users by adding an additional dimension. For example, if you want to simulate 5 users, you would change `[batch_size, k_ldpc]` to `[batch_size, num_users, k_ldpc]`.
2. Make sure that all subsequent operations are applied across the new user dimension as well.
3. Adjust the SNR to be a 3D tensor to apply the same SNR to each user independently.

Here's a code snippet based on the code provided in your context, modified to simulate 5 independent users:

```python
# Number of independent users to simulate
num_users = 5

# simulation parameters
batch_size = 1000
ebno_db = 4

# Generate a batch of random bit vectors for multiple users
b = binary_source([batch_size, num_users, k_ldpc])

# Encode the bits using the 5G LDPC code for each user
c = encoder(b)

# Map bits to constellation symbols for each user
x = mapper(c)

# Broadcast `ebno_db` to have the same dimension as `x` before transmission
ebno_db_tensor = tf.broadcast_to(ebno_db, [batch_size, num_users])
no = sionna.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db_tensor, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate)

# Transmit over an AWGN channel at SNR 'ebno_db' for each user
y = channel([x, no])

# Demap to LLRs for each user
llr = demapper([y, no])

# LDPC decoding using BP iterations for each user
b_hat = decoder(llr)

# Calculate BERs for each user
c_hat = tf.cast(tf.less(0.0, llr), tf.float32) # hard-decided bits before decoding.
ber_uncoded = sionna.utils.metrics.compute_ber(c, c_hat)

ber_coded = sionna.utils.metrics.compute_ber(b, b_hat)

print("BER uncoded = {:.3f} at EbNo = {:.1f} dB".format(tf.reduce_mean(ber_uncoded), ebno_db))
print("BER after decoding = {:.3f} at EbNo = {:.1f} dB".format(tf.reduce_mean(ber_coded), ebno_db))
print("In total {} bits were simulated for {} users".format(np.size(b.numpy()), num_users))
```

In this modified code, `num_users` represents the number of independent users in the simulation. The new dimension is included when generating the random bit vectors (`b`) and maintained throughout the encoding, mapping, channel, demapping, and decoding stages. The SNR is broadcasted to match the dimensions of `x` for consistency across users.

This code is an example of how to update the simulation to handle multiple independent users, with each user experiencing the channel independently of other users. The final BER calculation averages the result across all users.

### 7. INSTRUCTION:
Use Sionna's built-in plotting functions to visualize a 16-QAM constellation, showcasing how visual representations can aid research and understanding.

**ANSWER:**

As per the provided context, the Sionna package is a framework used for link-level simulation in communication systems. To visualize a 16-QAM constellation, we can use code similar to block [9] from the context, which instructs on plotting a constellation. We can modify the number of bits per symbol to match that of a 16-QAM modulation scheme which requires 4 bits per symbol.

Here is a step-by-step instruction on how to plot a 16-QAM constellation with Sionna:

1. Make sure you have installed the Sionna package as indicated in the context.

2. Import all required packages including Sionna, NumPy, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.
```python
import sionna
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

3. Configure the notebook to plot inline if you are running this in a Jupyter environment.
```python
%matplotlib inline
```

4. Create a constellation object with 4 bits per symbol for 16-QAM.
```python
constellation = sionna.mapping.Constellation("qam", num_bits_per_symbol=4)
```

5. Use the built-in `show` function of the constellation object to plot the 16-QAM constellation.
```python
constellation.show()
```

After executing the last line of code, a 16-QAM constellation should be displayed, showing the position of all possible symbols in the constellation diagram. These symbols correspond to different combinations of 4 bits, thus illustrating how the constellation supports the transmission of 4 bits of information per symbol.

If you are running this code in a Python script rather than a Jupyter notebook, you will need to add `plt.show()` to display the plot:

```python
plt.show()
```

The visualization can be used to understand symbol mappings, signal space separations, and to provide insights for research and analysis of modulation schemes like 16-QAM in digital communications.

### 8. INSTRUCTION:
Compile a comprehensive Sionna simulation using an LDPC encoder for channel coding and a QAM mapper, simulating a communication link that includes channel encoding, QAM mapping, AWGN channel transmission, and demapping.

**ANSWER:**

Based on the provided context and the instruction to compile a comprehensive Sionna simulation using an LDPC encoder for channel coding and a QAM mapper, here is how you could proceed:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import sionna
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming the required imports have been done as shown in the context
# and Sionna package is already imported

# Set up the simulation parameters
n_ldpc = 1000  # Length of the LDPC codeword
k_ldpc = 500   # Number of information bits
coderate = k_ldpc / n_ldpc
num_bits_per_symbol = 4  # For 16-QAM
batch_size = 1000  # Number of codewords to simulate in parallel
ebno_db = 6  # Target Eb/No for the simulation in dB

# Source
binary_source = sionna.utils.BinarySource()
b = binary_source([batch_size, k_ldpc])

# Channel Encoder (LDPC)
ldpc_encoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.LDPCEncoder(k_ldpc, n_ldpc)
encoded_bits = ldpc_encoder(b)

# Constellation and Mapper (16-QAM)
constellation = sionna.mapping.Constellation("qam", num_bits_per_symbol)
mapper = sionna.mapping.Mapper(constellation)
mapped_symbols = mapper(encoded_bits)

# AWGN Channel
channel = sionna.channel.AWGN()
noise_variance = sionna.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate)
noisy_symbols = channel([mapped_symbols, noise_variance])

# Demapper
demapper = sionna.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)
llr = demapper([noisy_symbols, noise_variance])

# LDPC Decoder
ldpc_decoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.LDPCDecoder(ldpc_encoder, num_iter=10)
decoded_bits = ldpc_decoder(llr)

# Performance Metrics
ber = sionna.utils.metrics.compute_ber(b, decoded_bits)

# Run the simulation
ber_result = ber[0].numpy()
print(f"The Bit Error Rate (BER) is {ber_result:.2e} at an Eb/No of {ebno_db} dB.")
```

This script will set up and simulate a communication link using an LDPC encoder for channel coding and a QAM mapper. It transmits the symbols through an AWGN channel, demaps them, decodes the received data, and computes the BER for the simulation at the specified Eb/No ratio of 6 dB.

Keep in mind that the specific values for `n_ldpc`, `k_ldpc`, `num_bits_per_symbol`, `batch_size`, and `ebno_db` can be adjusted as needed for different simulation scenarios. The code block is intended to be run in an environment where Sionna and TensorFlow have been installed and configured, as per the context provided. Make sure to run this code within a Jupyter notebook or another Python environment that supports TensorFlow.

### 9. INSTRUCTION:
Execute the Sionna simulation script in eager mode with adjustable parameters like batch size and SNR, and calculate uncoded and coded bit error rates (BER) to evaluate the system performance.

**ANSWER:**

To execute the Sionna simulation script in eager mode with adjustable parameters like batch size and SNR, adapting the given context, we first need to define a function `run_simulation` that wraps the entire simulation with configurable parameters. Let's proceed step by step, integrating the instructional demand into Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sionna.utils import BinarySource, ebnodb2no, metrics
from sionna.fec.ldpc import encoding, decoding
from sionna.mapping import Mapper, Demapper, Constellation
from sionna.channel import AWGN

# Define the simulation procedure
def run_simulation(batch_size, ebno_db):
    # Set system parameters
    n_ldpc = 500 # LDPC codeword length
    k_ldpc = 250 # number of info bits per LDPC codeword
    coderate = k_ldpc / n_ldpc
    num_bits_per_symbol = 4 # number of bits mapped to one symbol (16-QAM)
    
    # Initialization of the layers
    binary_source = BinarySource()
    encoder = encoding.LDPC5GEncoder(k_ldpc, n_ldpc)
    constellation = Constellation("qam", num_bits_per_symbol)
    mapper = Mapper(constellation=constellation)
    channel = AWGN()
    demapper = Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)
    decoder = decoding.LDPC5GDecoder(encoder, hard_out=True, cn_type="boxplus", num_iter=20)
    
    # Generate a batch of random bit vectors
    b = binary_source([batch_size, k_ldpc])

    # Encode the bits using 5G LDPC code
    c = encoder(b)

    # Map bits to constellation symbols
    x = mapper(c)

    # Transmit over an AWGN channel at the desired Eb/No
    no = ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate)
    y = channel([x, no])

    # Demap to LLRs
    llr = demapper([y, no])

    # LDPC decoding using 20 BP iterations
    b_hat = decoder(llr)

    # Calculate uncoded and coded BER
    c_hat = tf.cast(tf.less(0.0, llr), tf.float32) # Hard-decided bits before decoding
    ber_uncoded = metrics.compute_ber(c, c_hat)
    ber_coded = metrics.compute_ber(b, b_hat)

    return ber_uncoded.numpy(), ber_coded.numpy()

# Example: Run the simulation with adjustable parameters
batch_size = 1000  # Define your own batch size
ebno_db = 5       # Define your SNR in dB
uncoded_ber, coded_ber = run_simulation(batch_size, ebno_db)

print(f"Uncoded BER: {uncoded_ber} | Coded BER: {coded_ber} for Eb/No of {ebno_db} dB with batch size of {batch_size}")
```

This script initializes the necessary layers and runs a simulation cycle. Then, it returns both uncoded and coded BER values. You can call the `run_simulation` function with different values for `batch_size` and `ebno_db` to evaluate system performance under different conditions.

Please note, to actually run the script, you must set up an appropriate Python environment with TensorFlow and Sionna installed, and execute the script in an environment (such as Jupyter Notebook or a Python execution environment). The specified code is written to reflect the structure provided in your context. The actual execution depends on the system's setup and Sionna installation.

### 10. INSTRUCTION:
Explore different algorithm options available in Sionna by modifying demapping methods and LDPC belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithms and observing the impact on performance metrics such as BER.

**ANSWER:**

To explore different algorithm options available in Sionna and observe the impact on performance metrics such as BER, you can follow these steps:

1. Modifying the Demapping Method:
   - First, you need to specify the desired demapping method. Typically, "app" (a posteriori probability) and "max-log" are common options. The "max-log" is an approximation that simplifies calculations and is faster but less accurate.
   - Change the demapping method by setting `demapping_method` to "app" or "max-log":
     ```python
     demapping_method = "max-log"  # try "app" or "max-log"
     demapper = sionna.mapping.Demapper(demapping_method,
                                        constellation=constellation)
     ```

2. Modifying the LDPC BP Decoding Algorithm:
   - Similar to the demapper, LDPC BP decoder can use different check node (CN) update algorithms. For example, "boxplus" is an exact approach, while "minsum" is an approximation that can be computationally more efficient.
   - Switch the check node update method by modifying `ldpc_cn_type`:
     ```python
     ldpc_cn_type = "minsum"  # try "boxplus" or "minsum"
     decoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding.LDPC5GDecoder(encoder,
                                                      hard_out=True, cn_type=lddc_cn_type,
                                                      num_iter=20)
     ```
   
3. Running the Simulation:
   - After modifying the demapping method and LDPC BP decoding algorithm, you should run the simulation code, as described in the context provided in step [13].
   - With each modification, you must recalculate the BER by running the code starting from generating random bit vectors to decoding.
   
4. Comparing the Results:
   - After you've tried different combinations of demapping methods and LDPC decoding algorithms, compare the resulting BER values.
   - You may want to plot the BER against SNR values for each configuration to get a visual comparison.

Example Code to Change Demapper and LDPC Decode Type and Run Simulation:
```python
# Specify demapping method and LDPC BP decoding algorithm
demapping_method = "max-log"  # try "app" or "max-log"
ldpc_cn_type = "minsum"  # try "boxplus" or "minsum"

# Re-initialize the components with the new configurations
demapper = sionna.mapping.Demapper(demapping_method,
                                   constellation=constellation)
decoder = sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding.LDPC5GDecoder(encoder,
                                                 hard_out=True, cn_type=ldpc_cn_type,
                                                 num_iter=20)

# Run simulation as in step [13], or create a function to handle the repetitive simulation tasks.
# ...
# Calculate BER, as shown in [13].

# Print BER results
print("BER uncoded = {:.3f} at EbNo = {:.1f} dB".format(ber_uncoded, ebno_db))
print("BER after decoding = {:.3f} at EbNo = {:.1f} dB".format(ber_coded, ebno_db))
print("In total {} bits were simulated".format(np.size(b.numpy())))
```

Remember, this example is a guide. You will need to repeat the simulation with different configurations and compare the BER results for each configuration to understand the impact of these algorithm changes.

Please note that Sionna's configuration for demappers and LDPC decoding can change over time, and it's always a good idea to refer to the latest documentation for specifics.

### 11. INSTRUCTION:
Employ TensorFlow's graph execution for increased simulation speed by adapting your Sionna script for graph mode execution and comparing the simulation time with the eager mode execution.

**ANSWER:**

To enable TensorFlow's graph execution and compare simulation times between eager execution and graph mode, you can follow these steps:

1. **Wrap Simulation Code in a Function**: For graph execution, TensorFlow needs to know the computational graph in advance. So we must define the simulation as a function.

2. **Convert Function to a TensorFlow Graph**: Use `tf.function` to convert the simulation function into a graph.

3. **Run and Time the Eager Mode Execution**: Execute the simulation in eager mode and measure the time taken.

4. **Run and Time the Graph Mode Execution**: Execute the simulation in graph mode and measure the time taken.

5. **Compare the Times**: Print out the time taken by each mode to compare their performance.

Below is a code snippet demonstrating these steps, assuming you have already defined simulation code like the one in [13]:

```python
import time

# Step 1: Define simulation code as a function
def simulate_link_level(batch_size, ebno_db):
    # Re-use simulation code defined previously in your context, like the one in [13]
    # ...

# Step 2: Convert function to TensorFlow graph using tf.function decorator
@tf.function
def simulate_link_level_graph(batch_size, ebno_db):
    return simulate_link_level(batch_size, ebno_db)

# Step 3: Run and time the eager mode execution
start_time_eager = time.time()
ber_uncoded_eager, ber_coded_eager = simulate_link_level(batch_size=1000, ebno_db=4)
time_eager = time.time() - start_time_eager
print(f"Eager mode execution time: {time_eager:.4f} seconds")

# Step 4: Run and time the graph mode execution
start_time_graph = time.time()
ber_uncoded_graph, ber_coded_graph = simulate_link_level_graph(batch_size=1000, ebno_db=4)
time_graph = time.time() - start_time_graph
print(f"Graph mode execution time: {time_graph:.4f} seconds")

# Step 5: Compare the times
print(f"Speedup from Eager to Graph mode: {time_eager / time_graph:.2f}x")
```

Remember, this is a general guideline – you'll need to adapt the `simulate_link_level` function to include the actual computations for link-level simulations based on your existing code. Also, the first call to a `tf.function` decorated function can be slower due to the initial graph-building process; thus, it's recommended to time the subsequent calls.

### 12. INSTRUCTION:
Define a Keras model for end-to-end link-level simulations using the "sionna" package in Python. Ensure that the model simulates transmission over a multi-path channel with OFDM and BICM and uses 5G-compliant LDPC code for information bit protection. Structure the model class by inheriting `tf.keras.Model` and overriding the `__init__` and `call` methods, as shown in the provided context.

**ANSWER:**

Based on the provided context, here is a Python code snippet that defines a Keras model for end-to-end link-level simulations using the "sionna" package, which simulates transmission over a multi-path channel with OFDM and BICM, and uses 5G-compliant LDPC code for information bit protection:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna
import numpy as np

class E2EModel(tf.keras.Model):
    """
    Example model for end-to-end link-level simulations.
    
    This model simulates the transmission over a multi-path channel using OFDM
    and BICM with 5G-compliant LDPC code for bit protection.
    """
    def __init__(self, params):
        super(E2EModel, self).__init__()
        
        # Unpack parameters for easy access
        self.num_ofdm_symbols = params["num_ofdm_symbols"]
        self.fft_size = params["fft_size"]
        self.subcarrier_spacing = params["subcarrier_spacing"]
        self.cyclic_prefix_length = params["cyclic_prefix_length"]
        self.pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices = params["pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices"]
        self.coderate = params["coderate"]
        self.num_bits_per_symbol = params["num_bits_per_symbol"]
        self.demapping_method = params["demapping_method"]
        self.cn_type = params["cn_type"]
        self.bp_iter = params["bp_iter"]
        
        # Calculate derived parameters
        self.n = int(self.num_ofdm_symbols * self.num_bits_per_symbol)
        self.k = int(self.n * self.coderate)
        
        # Define the components of the link-level simulation
        # (ResourceGrid, Channel, Encoder, Interleaver, Mapper, etc.)
        # The configuration should align with the specified parameters

    def call(self, batch_size, ebno_db):
        # Define the forward pass of the model
        # Generate random bits, simulate transmission over the channel
        # and process the reception to recover the transmitted bits

        # Return the transmitted bits and the recovered bits
        return b, b_hat
```

Please note that in the provided context, there is already a definition for an end-to-end model class `e2e_model`. My response is another representation of such a class based on the provided context and instruction. However, for a full-fledged implementation, you would need to complete the comments denoted by `#` with the actual code, by adding the initialization of each required module (like the OFDM resource grid, the channel model, and so on) which is indicated in the provided context but not entirely shown as code snippets.

In the real implementation, for each Sionna component, you'll need to set up proper initialization based on the `params` dictionary, which holds all the configuration parameters for the different parts of the link-level simulation. The `call` method would contain the sequence of operation starting from bit source generation to bit recovery after simulation through the channel.

### 13. INSTRUCTION:
Create a dictionary named `sys_params` with parameters suitable for the simulated 5G environment, covering aspects of channel, OFDM, code, and modulation as outlined in the context. Ensure to set values for keys including 'carrier_frequency', 'delay_spread', 'min_speed', 'max_speed', 'fft_size', 'subcarrier_spacing', 'num_ofdm_symbols', 'cyclic_prefix_length', 'pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices', 'coderate', 'num_bits_per_symbol', 'demapping_method', 'cn_type', and 'bp_iter'.

**ANSWER:**

Based on the provided context, the `sys_params` dictionary should resemble the one provided in the context, with the corresponding key-value pairs assigned to the right parameters as described in the example code snippet. Here is the dictionary populated with the parameters suitable for the simulated 5G environment, matching the ones outlined in your context:

```python
sys_params = {
    # Channel
    "carrier_frequency": 3.5e9,  # in Hz
    "delay_spread": 100e-9,  # in seconds
    "min_speed": 3,  # in m/s
    "max_speed": 3,  # in m/s
    
    # OFDM
    "fft_size": 256,
    "subcarrier_spacing": 30e3,  # in Hz
    "num_ofdm_symbols": 14,
    "cyclic_prefix_length": 16,
    "pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices": [2, 11],
    
    # Code & Modulation
    "coderate": 0.5,
    "num_bits_per_symbol": 4,
    "demapping_method": "app",
    
    # LDPC Decoder
    "cn_type": "boxplus",
    "bp_iter": 20
}
```

This dictionary includes all necessary keys and adheres to the information specified in the context regarding channel conditions (like carrier frequency and delay spread), OFDM parameters (such as FFT size, subcarrier spacing, and the cyclic prefix length), as well as coding and modulation settings (including code rate, bits per symbol, and the demapping method). It also includes configurations specific to the channel decoder, such as the type of check node operation (cn_type) and the number of belief propagation iterations (bp_iter).

### 14. INSTRUCTION:
Initialize the end-to-end model using the `e2e_model` class and the `sys_params` dictionary. Execute the model with a given `batch_size` and `ebno_db` to simulate the bit-error rate (BER) and print the results, including the BER, the Eb/No value in dB, and the number of simulated bits.

**ANSWER:**

To simulate the bit-error rate (BER) using the `e2e_model` class and the `sys_params` dictionary with a given `batch_size` and `ebno_db`, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the `e2e_model` with the system parameters provided in the `sys_params` dictionary.
2. Execute the model with the specified `batch_size` and `ebno_db` to simulate the link-level performance and compute the BER.
3. Print the results, including the BER, the Eb/No value in dB, and the number of simulated bits.

Based on the provided context, execute the following Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna

# Define the system parameters dictionary as provided in the CONTEXT
sys_params = {
    # ... (other parameters as defined in the provided CONTEXT)
    "coderate":0.5,
    "num_bits_per_symbol":4,
    # ... (the remaining system parameters)
}

# Initialize the e2e_model with system parameters
model = e2e_model(sys_params)

# Define the simulation parameters
ebno_db = 10        # You can change this value as needed
batch_size = 200    # You can change this value as needed

# Call the model to simulate and compute BER
b, b_hat = model(batch_size, ebno_db)

# Compute the bit-error rate
ber = sionna.utils.metrics.compute_ber(b, b_hat)

# Calculate the number of simulated bits
nb_bits = np.size(b.numpy())

# Print the results
print(f"BER: {ber.numpy():.4} at Eb/No of {ebno_db} dB and {nb_bits} simulated bits")
```

Please replace the `ebno_db` and `batch_size` values with the specific values you want to use for the simulation. The code snippet computes the BER for a single Eb/No point and prints the results.

### 15. INSTRUCTION:
Measure and compare the throughput of the end-to-end model in different execution modes: eager, graph, and graph with XLA. Use the function `get_throughput` provided in the context, and output the results with print statements to show the throughput in megabits per second (Mb/s) for each mode.

**ANSWER:**

```python
import time
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the system parameters for the simulation
sys_params = {
    # Channel
    "carrier_frequency": 3.5e9,
    "delay_spread": 100e-9,
    "min_speed": 3,
    "max_speed": 3,
    "tdl_model": "A",

    # OFDM
    "fft_size": 256,
    "subcarrier_spacing": 30e3,
    "num_ofdm_symbols": 14,
    "cyclic_prefix_length": 16,
    "pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices": [2, 11],

    # Code & Modulation
    "coderate": 0.5,
    "num_bits_per_symbol": 4,
    "demapping_method": "app",
    "cn_type": "boxplus",
    "bp_iter": 20
}

# Initialize the model
model = e2e_model(sys_params)

# Define the batch size and Eb/No
batch_size = 200
ebno_db = 5
repetitions = 4

# Eager execution mode
time_eager = get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, run_eager, repetitions)

# Graph execution mode
time_graph = get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, run_graph, repetitions)

# Graph execution with XLA
sionna.config.xla_compat = True
time_graph_xla = get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, run_graph_xla, repetitions)
sionna.config.xla_compat = False

# Print the results
print(f"Throughput in eager execution: {time_eager/1e6:.2f} Mb/s")
print(f"Throughput in graph execution: {time_graph/1e6:.2f} Mb/s")
print(f"Throughput in graph execution with XLA: {time_graph_xla/1e6:.2f} Mb/s")
```

Ensure you have all the required variables, dependencies, and the `e2e_model` definition from the context available in your runtime environment when running this script. The `run_eager`, `run_graph`, and `run_graph_xla` functions are called within the `get_throughput` function to measure the throughput in the respective execution modes. The `sionna.config.xla_compat = True` line enables XLA compatibility, and it's set back to False afterwards to ensure multiple executions handle configuration resets accordingly. Finally, the throughput outcomes for each execution mode are printed in megabits per second (Mb/s).

### 16. INSTRUCTION:
Conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation of the bit-error rate (BER) across a range of SNR values using the `sim_ber` built-in simulation function from Sionna. Set appropriate values for `ebno_dbs`, `batch_size`, `max_mc_iter`, and `num_target_block_errors`. Activate the `sionna.config.xla_compat` feature before starting the simulation to ensure compatibility with XLA and deactivate it afterward. Display the simulation's progress and results, including BER, BLER, and number of errors versus the Eb/No ratio.

**ANSWER:**

To conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of the bit-error rate (BER) across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values using Sionna, you should follow these steps:

1. Set the required parameters for the simulation.
2. Activate the `sionna.config.xla_compat` feature to ensure compatibility with XLA.
3. Call the `sim_ber` built-in simulation function from Sionna.
4. Deactivate the `sionna.config.xla_compat` feature after the simulation.
5. Display the progress and results of the simulation.

Here is a code snippet that incorporates the instructions given:

```python
import numpy as np
import sionna

# Assuming 'model' is the instance of e2e_model already created
# and 'sys_params' dictionary has been defined according to the CONTEXT above.

# Set the simulation parameters
ebno_dbs = np.arange(0, 15, 1.) # A range of Eb/No values in dB
batch_size = 200                # Batch size for the simulation
max_mc_iter = 1000              # Maximum number of Monte Carlo iterations per SNR point
num_target_block_errors = 500   # Number of target block errors before moving to the next SNR point

# Activate the XLA compatibility
sionna.config.xla_compat = True

# Perform the Monte Carlo simulation of BER using the 'sim_ber' function
ber_results, bber_results, bit_errors, num_bits, block_errors, num_blocks, runtime, status = sionna.utils.sim_ber(
    run_graph_xla,                       # Simulation function, which is model in graph mode with XLA
    ebno_dbs,                            # SNR values
    batch_size=batch_size,               # Batch size for the simulation
    num_target_block_errors=num_target_block_errors, # Number of target block errors
    max_mc_iter=max_mc_iter,             # Maximum iterations
    verbose=True                         # Display progress
)

# Deactivate the XLA compatibility feature
sionna.config.xla_compat = False

# Display the results
print("Eb/No [dB]   BER         BLER        Bit Errors      Num Bits       Block Errors      Num Blocks")
for i in range(len(ebno_dbs)):
    print(f"{ebno_dbs[i]:<12}{ber_results[i]:<12}{bber_results[i]:<12}{bit_errors[i]:<15}{num_bits[i]:<15}{block_errors[i]:<15}{num_blocks[i]}")

# Plot the results
sionna.utils.plotting.plot_ber(
    ebno_dbs,
    ber_results,
    legend="E2E Model",
    ylabel="Coded BER"
)
```

Please replace the function `run_graph_xla` with the appropriate function or method that runs your simulation model in graph mode with XLA as indicated in your context.

Note: The above code assumes that the simulation function `run_graph_xla` and necessary Sionna imports have already been defined as shown in the provided context. If it's not predefined, you need to use the given `e2e_model` class to create an instance of the model and then define the simulation function `run_graph_xla` using the `@tf.function(jit_compile=True)` decorator as shown in the context. 

Also, your original context suggests that the `run_graph_xla` function is already implemented and used for throughput testing with XLA compatibility turned on. Ensure you utilize the same function while conducting the BER simulation. If necessary, adapt the code to fit into your developed notebook or script based on the code structure present.

### 17. INSTRUCTION:
Generate a BER plot using the `sionna.utils.plotting.plot_ber` function. Provide the plot with appropriate labels, titles, and legends to convey the results of the Monte-Carlo simulations effectively.

**ANSWER:**

To generate a Bit-Error Rate (BER) plot using the `sionna.utils.plotting.plot_ber` function, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure you have already performed Monte-Carlo simulations to collect BER data across a range of Eb/N0 values, as indicated in the context. This data will be used to generate the plot.
2. Import the `plot_ber` function from the `sionna.utils.plotting` module if it is not already imported.
3. Call the `plot_ber` function, passing in the Eb/N0 values and the corresponding BER measurements. You will also need to provide appropriate labels for the legend, axis labels, and a plot title.

Here is an example of how you might generate and display the BER plot, building upon the context provided:

```python
# Import the necessary module for plotting
from sionna.utils.plotting import plot_ber
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'ebno_dbs' contains the Eb/N0 values in dB
# and 'ber_mc' contains the corresponding BER measurements from the Monte-Carlo simulations
# Now we can use these results to plot the BER curve

# Plot BER curves
plot_ber(ebno_dbs,                       # X-axis data: the Eb/N0 values in dB
         ber_mc,                         # Y-axis data: the corresponding BER measurements
         legend="End-to-End Model BER",  # Legend label
         xlabel="Eb/N0 [dB]",            # X-axis label
         ylabel="BER",                   # Y-axis label
         title="BER vs Eb/N0"            # Plot title
         )

# Optionally, show the grid and set the plot to a logarithmic scale
plt.yscale('log')
plt.grid(True, which="both", ls="--")

# Finally, display the plot
plt.show()
```

With this code, you will generate a BER plot that uses the simulation data. The function call to `plot_ber` will assign appropriate labels and titles based on the values you passed, ensuring that the plot clearly conveys the results of the Monte-Carlo simulations.

Important notes:

- Replace `'ebno_dbs'` and `'ber_mc'` with the actual variables that hold your Eb/N0 values and BER measurements, respectively.
- Ensure that the plotting environment is properly configured, and that you have imported `matplotlib.pyplot` to display the plot.
- If you are running this in an interactive environment (like Jupyter Notebook), the `plt.show()` command may be optional depending on your configuration, as plots may be displayed automatically after each cell execution.
