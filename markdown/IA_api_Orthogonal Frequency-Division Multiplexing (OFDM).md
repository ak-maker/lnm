### 1. INSTRUCTION:
Create an instance of the `ResourceGrid` class in Sionna, setting parameters based on the provided context to structure a grid for OFDM symbols.

**ANSWER:**

Based on the given context, you can create an instance of the `ResourceGrid` class in Sionna by following the example given and adjusting the parameters to suit the intended structure of the OFDM grid. Here's Python code that creates an instance of a `ResourceGrid` for an OFDM-based system:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sionna.ofdm import ResourceGrid

# Assuming the following OFDM parameters:
num_ofdm_symbols = 14           # example number of OFDM symbols
fft_size = 512                  # example FFT size (number of subcarriers)
subcarrier_spacing = 15e3       # example subcarrier spacing in Hz
num_tx = 2                      # example number of transmitters
num_streams_per_tx = 2          # example number of streams per transmitter (assuming MIMO)
cyclic_prefix_length = 72       # example cyclic prefix length
num_guard_carriers = (6, 7)     # example number of guard carriers on each side
dc_null = True                  # example indicating DC subcarrier is nulled
pilot_pattern = "kronecker"     # example pilot pattern type
pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices = [3, 10]  # example indices of OFDM symbols used for pilots

# Create the ResourceGrid instance with the given parameters
resource_grid = ResourceGrid(num_ofdm_symbols=num_ofdm_symbols,
                             fft_size=fft_size,
                             subcarrier_spacing=subcarrier_spacing,
                             num_tx=num_tx,
                             num_streams_per_tx=num_streams_per_tx,
                             cyclic_prefix_length=cyclic_prefix_length,
                             num_guard_carriers=num_guard_carriers,
                             dc_null=dc_null,
                             pilot_pattern=pilot_pattern,
                             pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices=pilot_ofdm_symbol_indices,
                             dtype=tf.complex64)

# Visualize the Resource Grid
resource_grid.show()
```

Make sure to replace the example values provided with the actual parameters that correspond to your specific requirements for the OFDM grid structure. The values in the example (including number of OFDM symbols, FFT size, subcarrier spacing, and others) should be set based on the system specifications you are working with.

Remember to install Sionna, TensorFlow, and any other necessary libraries before trying to run the code.

### 2. INSTRUCTION:
Utilize the `ResourceGridMapper` class in Sionna to map a tensor of complex-valued data symbols onto your previously created resource grid.

**ANSWER:**

To map a tensor of complex-valued data symbols onto your previously created resource grid using Sionna, you should first create an instance of the `ResourceGridMapper` class and then call it with your data symbols tensor as input. Here is how you might proceed with the information provided:

Your first step would be to create an instance of the `ResourceGrid` class, which was described in the provided context. For the purpose of this example, let's assume you have already created this instance and named it `resource_grid`.

Now, we need to create an instance of the `ResourceGridMapper` class:

```python
from sionna.ofdm import ResourceGridMapper

# Assuming an existing resource grid instance named `resource_grid`
# You might have a complex tensor named `data_symbols_tensor`
# representing the modulated data symbols that need to be mapped,
# with shape [batch_size, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_data_symbols]

# Create the ResourceGridMapper instance
resource_grid_mapper = ResourceGridMapper(resource_grid=resource_grid)

# Now use the mapper to map your complex data symbols tensor onto the resource grid
mapped_resource_grid = resource_grid_mapper(data_symbols_tensor)
```

In the code snippet above, placeholders like `resource_grid` and `data_symbols_tensor` need to be replaced with actual instances that were prepared in your previous steps:

- `resource_grid` should be the `ResourceGrid` instance you created with the necessary parameters such as number of OFDM symbols, subcarrier spacing, etc., according to your simulation setup.
- `data_symbols_tensor` should be a tensor containing the complex-valued symbols you wish to map onto the resource grid. Its shape must follow the input requirements for the `ResourceGridMapper`, which is `[batch_size, num_tx, num_streams_per_tx, num_data_symbols]`.

Make sure to define `data_symbols_tensor` appropriately with randomly generated QAM symbols or symbols from your encoding process.

By executing the `resource_grid_mapper(data_symbols_tensor)` line, the data symbols are mapped onto the resource grid considering pilots, guard carriers, and DC nulling specified in the `resource_grid`. The resultant `mapped_resource_grid` is now ready to be processed, such as being sent through an `OFDMModulator` for conversion to time-domain signals.

### 3. INSTRUCTION:
Explain the basic concept and purpose of OFDM in the context of wireless communication systems.

**ANSWER:**

Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a method of digital signal modulation where a single data stream is split across multiple closely spaced subcarrier frequencies to provide robustness against frequency-selective fading and to improve spectral efficiency.

The basic concept of OFDM involves dividing the available frequency spectrum into multiple orthogonal subcarriers. These subcarriers are spaced apart at precise frequencies, which makes them orthogonal to one another, hence the name 'Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing'. This orthogonality prevents the subcarriers from interfering with each other despite the lack of a guard band between them, enabling efficient use of the spectrum.

OFDM's primary purpose in wireless communication systems is to maximize the data rate and efficiency of data transmission over a channel that exhibits frequency selectivity due to multipath propagation. By breaking down the frequency band into multiple narrowband flat-fading sub-channels, OFDM minimizes inter-symbol interference (ISI) and simplifies equalization at the receiver.

In a typical OFDM system, data symbols are first mapped onto subcarriers using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). Then, a cyclic prefix (CP) is often added to each OFDM symbol to provide a buffer against ISI and to maintain orthogonality. The resulting signal is transmitted over the air. At the receiver, the CP is removed, and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to extract the data from the individual subcarriers.

OFDM is widely used in various communication standards, including Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax), digital television broadcasting (DVB-T/DVB-T2), and 4G/5G cellular networks. It has become the modulation technique of choice for broadband wireless communications because of its ability to handle high data rates and its resilience to multipath fading and other channel impairments.
