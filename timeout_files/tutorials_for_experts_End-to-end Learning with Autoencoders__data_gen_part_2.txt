End-to-end Learning with Autoencoders
In this notebook, you will learn how to implement an end-to-end communication system as an autoencoder [1]. The implemented system is shown in the figure below. An additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered. On the transmitter side, joint training of the constellation geometry and bit-labeling is performed, as in [2]. On the receiver side, a neural network-based demapper that computes log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) on the transmitted bits from the received samples is optimized. The considered autoencoder is benchmarked against a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with Gray labeling and the optimal AWGN demapper.
Two algorithms for training the autoencoder are implemented in this notebook:
Conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation, which assumes a differentiable channel model and therefore optimizes the end-to-end system by backpropagating the gradients through the channel (see, e.g., [1]).
The training algorithm from [3], which does not assume a differentiable channel model, and which trains the end-to-end system by alternating between conventional training of the receiver and reinforcement learning (RL)-based training of the transmitter. Compared to [3], an additional step of fine-tuning of the receiver is performed after alternating training.
Note: For an introduction to the implementation of differentiable communication systems and their optimization through SGD and backpropagation with Sionna, please refer to the Part 2 of the Sionna tutorial for Beginners.

## Trainable End-to-end System RL-based Training
The following cell defines the same end-to-end system as before, but stop the gradients after the channel to simulate a non-differentiable channel.
To jointly train the transmitter and receiver over a non-differentiable channel, we follow [3], which key idea is to alternate between:
Training of the receiver on the BCE using conventional backpropagation and SGD.
Training of the transmitter by applying (known) perturbations to the transmitter output to enable estimation of the gradient of the transmitter weights with respect to an approximation of the loss function.
When training is set to True, both losses for training the receiver and the transmitter are returned.
