INSTRUCTION: Initialize the package `sionna` after checking if it is already installed, and also import TensorFlow and NumPy into your Python project, setting up the environment to avoid TensorFlow warnings.
ANSWER:To initialize the `sionna` package and import TensorFlow and NumPy into your Python project while setting up the environment to suppress TensorFlow warnings, follow these steps:

```python
# Step 1: Check if `sionna` is already installed, and if not, install it.
try:
    import sionna as sn
except ImportError:
    # If not installed, install Sionna
    import os
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna as sn

# Step 2: Import TensorFlow and NumPy
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Step 3: Set up environment to avoid TensorFlow warnings
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # This suppresses most of the TensorFlow warnings
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')  # This sets the TensorFlow logger to report only errors

# Now you can use `sionna`, `tensorflow`, and `numpy` in your project.
```

Ensure that you run this script in a Python environment where you have the necessary permissions to install packages and configure settings.

INSTRUCTION: Execute a shell command within a Jupyter notebook to check the status of NVIDIA GPUs available in your system using `nvidia-smi`.
ANSWER:To execute a shell command within a Jupyter notebook to check the status of NVIDIA GPUs available in your system using `nvidia-smi`, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you are in a Jupyter notebook environment, such as Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Create a new code cell if one is not already available.
3. In the code cell, type the command prefixed with an exclamation mark `!`, which indicates that you are running a shell command. The command to type is:

```python
!nvidia-smi
```

4. After typing the command, run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard or by clicking the "Run" button in the notebook's toolbar.

Running this command will display the output directly in the Jupyter notebook, showing you the status of NVIDIA GPUs in your system, including GPU utilization, memory usage, driver version, and more. The output will be similar to the one shown in the provided context.

INSTRUCTION: Define the fundamental design paradigms for efficient dataflow within Sionna, focusing on the aspects of parallelization, component implementation as Keras layers, datatype preferences, execution modes, auto-differentiability, and code structuring.
ANSWER:Based on the provided context, the fundamental design paradigms for efficient dataflow within Sionna can be defined as follows:

1. **Parallelization:**
   Sionna exploits parallelization by leveraging the batch dimension of tensors, where each element in the batch dimension represents an independent simulation instance. This approach enables inter-frame parallelization and allows operations to be performed concurrently, resulting in improved computational efficiency.

2. **Component Implementation as Keras Layers:**
   To facilitate the construction of complex communication systems, signal-processing components within Sionna are implemented as individual Keras layers. This integration allows users to build systems using the Keras functional API, making the composition of layers straightforward and modular.

3. **Datatype Preferences:**
   When dealing with data within Sionna, the preferred datatype for real-valued operations is `tf.float32`, while for complex-valued operations, `tf.complex64` is favored. This consistency in datatypes simplifies the reuse of components across various types of inputs. Higher precision datatypes such as `tf.float64` and `tf.complex128` are also available for simulations that require greater numerical accuracy.

4. **Execution Modes:**
   Sionna allows the development of models in eager execution mode, which aids in rapid prototyping by permitting immediate evaluation of operations and simplified debugging. For more intensive number crunching, Sionna can also perform simulations in graph mode or leverage XLA acceleration (still experimental) to improve performance further.

5. **Auto-Differentiability:**
   A key feature of Sionna is its support for auto-differentiability. Whenever possible, components are designed to be differentiable using TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities. This feature is crucial for integrating deep learning approaches within communication systems, as it simplifies the gradient computation required for training neural networks.

6. **Code Structuring:**
   Sionna's codebase is organized into sub-packages that cater to different tasks such as channel coding, mapping, etc. This modular structure not only enhances the maintainability of the code but also improves the user experience by making it easier to locate and utilize various components. The API documentation provides detailed insights into the organization and usage of these sub-packages.

In summary, Sionna's design paradigms are crafted to ensure that the dataflow is efficient, components are easy to reuse and integrate, and that the framework is well-suited for both traditional simulations and novel approaches involving deep learning in communication systems.

INSTRUCTION: Instantiate a QAM constellation in Sionna by setting up the number of bits per symbol to create a QPSK constellation, and visualize the constellation diagram.
ANSWER:To instantiate a QAM constellation in Sionna with a QPSK configuration and visualize the constellation diagram, we will need to do the following steps:

1. Set the number of bits per symbol to 2, since QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) is a modulation scheme with 4 symbols, each representing 2 bits.
2. Create a QAM constellation object using the `Constellation` class provided by Sionna with the specified number of bits per symbol.
3. Use the `show()` method from the constellation object to visualize the constellation diagram.

Below is the Python code that follows these steps using the context provided. This code is meant to be run inside a Jupyter notebook with the Sionna library installed.

```python
# Import Sionna if not already done
import sionna as sn

# Set number of bits per symbol to 2 for QPSK
NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL = 2

# Create a QAM constellation for QPSK
constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation("qam", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL)

# Visualize the constellation diagram
constellation.show()
```

Note that you need to replace the import statements and other setups if you're running this script outside of the Jupyter notebook from the context provided. However, based on the context's introductory parts, this code should set up and display the QPSK constellation diagram within the Sionna framework assuming you're working within a similar environment.

INSTRUCTION: Alter the QAM constellation code you have written by changing the modulation order to 16-QAM and view the updated constellation diagram.
ANSWER:To alter the QAM constellation code written in the context to 16-QAM and view the updated constellation diagram, follow these steps:

1. Change the `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL` variable to 4 since 16-QAM requires 4 bits per symbol.
2. Reinitialize the constellation object with the new modulation order.
3. Use the updated constellation object to regenerate the mapper and demapper.
4. Display the new constellation diagram using the `show()` method of the constellation object.

Here's the modified code written for the Sionna framework in Python:

```python
# First, adjust the number of bits per symbol for 16-QAM
NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL = 4  # 16-QAM

# (Re-)Create the QAM constellation for 16-QAM
constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation("qam", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL)

# Display the updated constellation diagram
constellation.show();

# Now set up the mapper and demapper with the new constellation
mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper(constellation=constellation)
demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)

# The rest of the code runs as before ---------------------------------------

# Definitions of binary source, AWGN channel, and the rest would be the same
# as given in the original tutorial.
```

To execute the changes, you'll need to run this code in the appropriate environment where the Sionna library is installed, which in this case is likely Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (as mentioned in the context). You will then see an updated plot that visualizes the 16-QAM constellation diagram.

INSTRUCTION: Utilize the API documentation within a Jupyter notebook to gather information on the Mapper class signature and its associated docstring by employing the Shift+TAB shortcut.
ANSWER:To gather information on the `Mapper` class signature and its associated docstring using the Shift+TAB shortcut within a Jupyter notebook, you would follow these steps:

1. First, ensure you are in a code cell within your Jupyter notebook.
2. Type the name of the class `sn.mapping.Mapper` but do not press Enter yet.
3. Position your cursor right after `.Mapper` and press Shift + TAB once to bring up a tooltip with a brief signature and docstring summary.
4. If you press Shift + TAB four times in succession, you should get a larger, persistent tooltip that provides detailed information about the `Mapper` class, including its full signature and extended docstring.

Here is what you would type in the cell before using the shortcut:

```python
sn.mapping.Mapper
```

Remember to position the cursor after `Mapper` and then press Shift + TAB as needed to display the tooltip. If this shortcut does not work for any reason (e.g., due to a different configuration of the Jupyter notebook environment), you could alternatively use the following commands within a different code cell to output the information:

For the signature:
```python
sn.mapping.Mapper?
```

For the source code including the docstring:
```python
sn.mapping.Mapper??
```

Please execute these instructions in a Jupyter notebook environment that has the appropriate libraries installed and running (in this case, Sionna). Since we are in a text-based Q&A environment and not in a live Jupyter notebook, the actual execution of these commands is not possible here.

INSTRUCTION: Print the class definition and documentation of the `Mapper` class in Sionna to examine its functions, using the `??` operator in your Jupyter notebook.
ANSWER:To print the class definition and documentation of the `Mapper` class in Sionna using the `??` operator in your Jupyter notebook, enter the following command in a Jupyter notebook cell:

```python
sn.mapping.Mapper??
```

This command will display both the signature of the class and its source code, including any inline comments that serve as documentation. It's a convenient way to explore the implementation details and usage instructions of a class within an interactive Jupyter environment.

INSTRUCTION: Implement the creation of binary source, mapper, demapper, and an AWGN channel in Sionna to enable the transmission of bits through a noisy environment.
ANSWER:You can implement the creation of binary source, mapper, demapper, and an AWGN channel and enable the transmission of bits through a noisy environment in Sionna by following the steps outlined in the provided context. Below is the code that performs these steps in a Python environment where Sionna and TensorFlow are installed:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna as sn
import numpy as np

# Parameters
NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL = 2 # For QPSK
BATCH_SIZE = 64 # Number of frames/blocks processed in parallel
BLOCK_LENGTH = 1024 # Number of bits in each block
EbN0_dB = 10.0 # Eb/N0 value in dB

# Create QAM Constellation
constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation("qam", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL)

# Mapper and Demapper
mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper(constellation=constellation)
demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)

# Binary source
binary_source = sn.utils.BinarySource()

# AWGN channel
awgn_channel = sn.channel.AWGN()

# Compute noise spectral density from Eb/N0
N0 = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db=EbN0_dB,
                        num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,
                        coderate=1.0) # Coderate set to 1 for uncoded transmission

# Generate random bits
bits = binary_source([BATCH_SIZE, BLOCK_LENGTH])

# Map bits to symbols
symbols = mapper(bits)

# Pass symbols through AWGN channel
y = awgn_channel([symbols, N0])

# Demap received symbols to LLRs
llrs = demapper([y, N0])

# Visualize the received noisy samples
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.axes().set_aspect(1)
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Channel output')
plt.xlabel('Real Part')
plt.ylabel('Imaginary Part')
plt.scatter(tf.math.real(y), tf.math.imag(y))
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

You may run this code within the context of a Python environment that has the necessary libraries (Sionna and TensorFlow) installed. This script defines a simple communication system that uses QPSK modulation and transmits bits over an AWGN channel. It also includes visualization of the received noisy symbols after passing through the channel.

It's important to adapt the `BATCH_SIZE`, `BLOCK_LENGTH`, and any other parameters to match the needs of your specific simulation. Furthermore, while noise is being added in the AWGN channel, one might need to implement a bit error rate (BER) computation to evaluate the performance of the communication link, which, however, is not explicitly included in the current code snippet.

INSTRUCTION: Set up a function using Sionna's utilities to convert a given `Eb/N0` in dB to the noise power spectral density ratio `N0`, defining the required parameters such as bitrate and coderate.
ANSWER:To set up a function using Sionna's utilities to convert a given `Eb/N0` in dB to the noise power spectral density ratio `N0`, we need to first import the necessary modules and define the function along with the required parameters, such as bitrate and coderate. Note that the `ebnodb2no` utility function from Sionna already handles this conversion when given the correct parameters.

Here is a step-by-step function, I'll call it `ebnodb_to_no`, setting up this functionality in Python using the tutorial context as reference:

```python
import sionna as sn

def ebnodb_to_no(ebnodb, bitrate, coderate):
    """
    Convert Eb/N0 in dB to the noise power spectral density ratio N0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ebnodb : float
        The energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio in dB.
    bitrate : float
        The bit rate of the transmission.
    coderate : float
        The code rate of the channel coding scheme.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The noise power spectral density ratio N0.
    """
    # Calculate the number of bits per symbol for the given bitrate
    # For simplicity, in this particular function, we assume BPSK modulation (1 bit per symbol)
    num_bits_per_symbol = 1

    # Use Sionna's utility function to calculate N0
    n0 = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebnodb,
                            num_bits_per_symbol=num_bits_per_symbol,
                            coderate=coderate)
    return n0
```

This `ebnodb_to_no` function takes as input the `Eb/N0` in dB, the bitrate, and the coderate. Inside the function, it uses the Sionna utility `ebnodb2no` to compute the `N0`. In practice, the number of bits per symbol will depend on the modulation scheme used (`NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`), but for the sake of the function and context provided, I assumed BPSK (1 bit per symbol).

To use this function in a real application, you would have to adjust the `num_bits_per_symbol` parameter according to the actual modulation scheme. For QPSK, for example, `num_bits_per_symbol` would be set to 2.

An example call to the function, assuming a bitrate of 1 Mbit/s and a coderate of 0.5, would look like this:

```python
ebnodb = 10.0  # Example value in dB
bitrate = 1e6  # Bitrate in bps
coderate = 0.5 # Coderate

# Compute N0
n0 = ebnodb_to_no(ebnodb, bitrate, coderate)

print(f"The noise power spectral density ratio N0 is: {n0}")
```

Adjust the parameters above according to the actual link configuration that you are evaluating.

INSTRUCTION: Define the batch size and block length for a simple data transmission simulation, creating tensors for bits, transmitted symbols, noisy channel output, and demapped log-likelihood ratios, and then print their shapes to verify proper dimensionality.
ANSWER:To fulfill the instruction specified, we need to define the batch size and block length, create tensors for the bits, transmitted symbols, noisy channel output, and demapped log-likelihood ratios, and finally, print their shapes to verify the dimensionality. Below is the Python code designed for this simulation task using Sionna:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna as sn

# Given context describes the details for QPSK, let's reuse those details
NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL = 2  # For QPSK constellation

# Define the batch size and block length to simulate
BATCH_SIZE = 64  # Number of examples processed in parallel
BLOCK_LENGTH = 1024  # Number of bits per example

# Create a binary source for generating random bits
binary_source = sn.utils.BinarySource()

# Generate random bits
bits = binary_source([BATCH_SIZE, BLOCK_LENGTH])

# Create a constellation and a mapper for QPSK
constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation("qam", NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL)
mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper(constellation=constellation)

# Map the bits to symbols using the mapper
symbols = mapper(bits)

# Define an AWGN channel
awgn_channel = sn.channel.AWGN()

# Assume an Eb/N0 value in dB for simulation
EB_NO_DB = 10
no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db=EB_NO_DB,
                        num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,
                        coderate=1.0)  # Uncoded transmission here

# Pass the symbols through the AWGN channel
noisy_symbols = awgn_channel([symbols, no])

# Create a demapper
demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)

# Demap the received symbols to get log-likelihood ratios (LLRs)
llrs = demapper([noisy_symbols, no])

# Print the shapes of the tensors to verify the dimensionality
print("Shapes of the created tensors:")
print(f"Bits tensor shape: {bits.shape}")
print(f"Transmitted symbols tensor shape: {symbols.shape}")
print(f"Noisy channel output tensor shape: {noisy_symbols.shape}")
print(f"Demapped LLRs tensor shape: {llrs.shape}")
```

Explanation:
1. We use the `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL` which informs us we are simulating QPSK (2 bits per symbol).
2. `BATCH_SIZE` is defined as the number of parallel examples, while `BLOCK_LENGTH` is the number of bits for each example (frame) in the simulation.
3. We instantiate a binary source and generate random bits of shape `[BATCH_SIZE, BLOCK_LENGTH]`.
4. After defining the `Constellation` and `Mapper`, we map these bits to QPSK symbols.
5. We utilize the `awgn_channel` to simulate the transmission over AWGN noise with a specified Eb/N0 ratio.
6. `Demapper` is created to demap the noisy received symbols to compute LLRs.
7. Finally, we print the shapes of each tensor to check whether they have the correct dimensions, indicating the simulation components are set up correctly.

INSTRUCTION: Display a selected number of samples from the simulation by printing the first few transmitted bits, transmitted symbols, received symbols, and demapped LLRs, to understand the data at each stage of the communication system.
ANSWER:Based on the provided context, here is how you can display a selected number of samples from the simulation:

```python
# Assuming all necessary components from the context have been
# initialized, such as the BinarySource, Mapper, AWGN channel, etc.

# Define the number of samples you want to display
num_samples_to_display = 10

# Generate a batch of random bits
bits = binary_source([BATCH_SIZE, 1024])  # Example BATCH_SIZE and bit sequence length

# Map the bits into symbols
transmitted_symbols = mapper(bits)

# Transmit symbols through the AWGN channel
received_symbols = awgn_channel([transmitted_symbols, no])

# Demap the received symbols into LLRs
demapped_llrs = demapper([received_symbols, no])

# Display the first few values based on num_samples_to_display
print(f"First {num_samples_to_display} transmitted bits:\n{bits[0, :num_samples_to_display].numpy()}")
print(f"First {num_samples_to_display // NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL} transmitted symbols:\n{transmitted_symbols[0, :num_samples_to_display // NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL].numpy()}")
print(f"First {num_samples_to_display // NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL} received symbols:\n{received_symbols[0, :num_samples_to_display // NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL].numpy()}")
print(f"First {num_samples_to_display} demapped LLRs:\n{demapped_llrs[0, :num_samples_to_display].numpy()}")
```

Make sure that you have `BATCH_SIZE`, `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`, the `binary_source`, `mapper`, `awgn_channel`, and `demapper` variables properly initialized before running this code, as mentioned in the context you provided.

This script will print the requested sample data from each stage of the communication system simulation: the first few bits transmitted, the corresponding transmitted symbols, the received symbols after passing through the AWGN channel, and finally, the demapped soft Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).

Remember to adjust `num_samples_to_display` according to how much data you'd like to inspect. You might also need to divide `num_samples_to_display` by `NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL` to match the number of transmitted and received symbols, because each symbol can represent multiple bits depending on the modulation scheme used (`NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL`).

INSTRUCTION: Plot the received noisy QAM symbols on a complex scatter plot to visualize the real and imaginary parts, ensuring proper axis labeling and aspect ratio settings.
ANSWER:Based on the provided context, here is code to perform the task using the Sionna package and the imported modules:

```python
# Since Sionna and matplotlib are already imported, we can go straight to the plotting

# Define the noise level for the AWGN channel
ebno_db = 10.0 # Example Eb/N0 value in dB
no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db=ebno_db,
                        num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,
                        coderate=1.0) # Coderate is set to 1 for uncoded transmission

# Simulate transmission
BATCH_SIZE = 64 # Number of examples processed in parallel
NUM_SYMBOLS = 1024 # Number of symbols per batch

# Generate random bits
bits = binary_source([BATCH_SIZE, NUM_SYMBOLS])

# Map bits to QAM symbols
x = mapper(bits)

# Transmit symbols through AWGN channel
y = awgn_channel([x, no])

# Visualize the received noisy samples on a complex scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.plot(np.real(y[0].numpy()), np.imag(y[0].numpy()), 'o', label='Received Symbols')
plt.title('Received Noisy QAM Symbols')
plt.xlabel('Real Part')
plt.ylabel('Imaginary Part')
plt.grid(True)
plt.axis('equal') # Set equal aspect ratio
plt.legend(loc='best')
plt.show()
```

In this code:
- We use `ebno_db` to set the `Eb/N0` in dB (which you can adjust as needed).
- The `no` variable is computed using Sionna's `ebnodb2no` function, converting `Eb/N0` to noise power spectral density `N_0`.
- We generate a batch of random bits using the `BinarySource`.
- The bits are mapped to QAM symbols using the `Mapper` created earlier in the context.
- The `AWGN` channel is used to add noise to the transmitted symbols.
- Finally, the noisy received samples are plotted on a complex scatter plot where the real part is on the x-axis and the imaginary part is on the y-axis. We ensure the plot has an equal aspect ratio using `plt.axis('equal')`.

Adjust the value of `ebno_db` to see how the noise affects the scatter plot. The received noisy symbols should be centered around the constellation points. As the `Eb/N0` decreases (i.e., noise increases), the points will spread further out from their ideal positions.

INSTRUCTION: Experiment with varying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in your simulation and observe the effect on the scatter plot of the received symbols, adjusting the noise level accordingly.
ANSWER:To experiment with varying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in your simulation and observe its effect on the scatter plot of the received symbols, follow these steps:

1. Set up the simulation environment as shown in the context using Sionna and TensorFlow libraries.
2. After you have initialized the mapper, binary source, and AWGN channel as shown in steps [3] to [7], define a range of Eb/N0 values in decibels (dB) that you would like to test. You can use a list or a NumPy array for this purpose.
3. Create a loop that iterates through each value of Eb/N0 in dB. Inside this loop, convert the current Eb/N0 from dB to the noise variance N0 using the provided utility function `sn.utils.ebnodb2no()`.
4. With the noise variance calculated, pass the symbols `x` through the AWGN channel with the specified N0 value.
5. After passing the symbols through the AWGN channel, you will get noisy received symbols `y`.
6. Plot the scatter plot of these received symbols using `matplotlib` as shown in step [11]. You will call `plt.scatter` function to do this, and you may use `plt.figure()` to create a new figure for each SNR level if you wish to have individual plots.
7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for each Eb/N0 value and observe the changes in the scatter plot. As the SNR decreases, you should notice that the constellation points get more spread out due to increased noise, making it harder to distinguish between the different symbols.

Here is a pseudocode example based on the given context:

```python
# Define a range of Eb/N0 values in dB to test
ebno_db_values = np.linspace(0, 20, num=5)  # for example from 0dB to 20dB with 5 points

# Iterate through the range of Eb/N0 values
for ebno_db in ebno_db_values:
    # Convert Eb/N0 in dB to N0
    no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db=ebno_db,
                            num_bits_per_symbol=NUM_BITS_PER_SYMBOL,
                            coderate=1.0)  # Assuming uncoded transmission

    # Generate a batch of random bits
    bits = binary_source([BATCH_SIZE, 1024])  # Example batch size and block length

    # Map the bits to constellation symbols
    x = mapper(bits)

    # Pass the symbols through the AWGN channel with the calculated N0
    y = awgn_channel([x, no])

    # Plot the scatter plot of the received symbols
    plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
    plt.axes().set_aspect(1)
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.title(f'Channel output for Eb/N0 = {ebno_db} dB')
    plt.xlabel('Real Part')
    plt.ylabel('Imaginary Part')
    plt.scatter(tf.math.real(y), tf.math.imag(y))
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

Remember to run the actual code in a notebook cell or equivalent Python environment that supports Sionna and TensorFlow. Replace the pseudocode comments and values with actual code corresponding to your simulation setup.

INSTRUCTION: Conduct advanced analysis by comparing the distribution of LLRs resulting from different demapping strategies, such as approximate log probability (APP) and max-log demapping, referencing the Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation example provided by Sionna for guidance.
ANSWER:To conduct an advanced analysis by comparing the distribution of Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) resulting from different demapping strategies, you would need to modify the provided Sionna code to initialize and compare two different demappers: one for Approximate Log Probability (APP) demapping and one for max-log demapping. The `advanced_task` at the end of the provided context suggests referencing the Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation example, but since we don't have the example here, we will proceed with the context given.

First, let's initialize two demappers, one with the "app" algorithm and the other with the "max-log" algorithm, right after the existing initialization of the binary source and the mapper:

```python
# Initialize the APP demapper
app_demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=constellation)

# Initialize the max-log demapper
maxlog_demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("maxlog", constellation=constellation)
```

Next, we need to compute LLRs using both demappers from the received noisy samples `y`:

```python
# Compute LLRs using the APP demapping algorithm
llr_app = app_demapper([y, no])

# Compute LLRs using the max-log demapping algorithm
llr_maxlog = maxlog_demapper([y, no])
```

After computing LLRs using both methods, we would want to visualize and compare the distributions of the LLRs. We can do this by using histograms or kernel density estimates. The following code snippet provides a way to plot the distributions:

```python
# Flatten the LLR tensors as we are only interested in the distribution, not the structure
llr_app_flat = tf.reshape(llr_app, [-1])
llr_maxlog_flat = tf.reshape(llr_maxlog, [-1])

# Use matplotlib to plot histograms
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

# Plot histogram of LLRs from APP demapping
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.hist(llr_app_flat.numpy(), bins=50, alpha=0.75, label='APP LLRs')
plt.title('Histogram of APP LLRs')
plt.xlabel('LLR Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()

# Plot histogram of LLRs from max-log demapping
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.hist(llr_maxlog_flat.numpy(), bins=50, alpha=0.75, color='red', label='Max-log LLRs')
plt.title('Histogram of Max-log LLRs')
plt.xlabel('LLR Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.legend()

plt.show()
```

This code will generate two subplots, each displaying the histogram of LLRs calculated by the different demapping strategies, allowing you to visually compare them.

For a more quantitative analysis, you could compute statistical measures like the mean and the standard deviation of the LLRs and then compare these metrics between the two methods. Furthermore, you could simulate over a range of SNR values and analyze how the distribution of LLRs changes with respect to noise level.

Lastly, remember that you will need to simulate a sufficiently large number of bits to adequately represent the distributions. The example uses a batch size of 64 with 1024 bits each. Depending on how closely you want to examine the distributions, you may need to adjust these numbers.

As a note, since we do not have the actual Sionna Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation example notebook, you will need to adapt the instructions to your specific scenario and requirements based on your resources and the Sionna documentation.



INSTRUCTION: Initialize a Sionna `UncodedSystemAWGN` model for a point-to-point link simulation with QAM16 modulation and a block length of 1024 bits.
ANSWER:To initialize an `UncodedSystemAWGN` model within Sionna for a point-to-point link simulation with 16-QAM modulation and a block length of 1024 bits, you can follow the pattern shown in the provided context. The context provides an example of a similar class structure including the `__init__` and `__call__` methods, which you'll use to set up the model.

Here's how you can implement it in code, based on the information provided in the context:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna as sn
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

class UncodedSystemAWGN(Model):
    def __init__(self, num_bits_per_symbol, block_length):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_bits_per_symbol = num_bits_per_symbol
        self.block_length = block_length
        # Create 16-QAM constellation
        self.constellation = sn.mapping.Constellation("qam", self.num_bits_per_symbol)
        self.mapper = sn.mapping.Mapper(constellation=self.constellation)
        self.demapper = sn.mapping.Demapper("app", constellation=self.constellation)
        self.binary_source = sn.utils.BinarySource()
        self.awgn_channel = sn.channel.AWGN()

    def __call__(self, batch_size, ebno_db):
        no = sn.utils.ebnodb2no(ebno_db,
                                num_bits_per_symbol=self.num_bits_per_symbol,
                                coderate=1.0)
        bits = self.binary_source([batch_size, self.block_length])
        x = self.mapper(bits)
        y = self.awgn_channel([x, no])
        llr = self.demapper([y,no])
        return bits, llr

# Instantiate the model with 16-QAM modulation (4 bits per symbol) and block length 1024
num_bits_per_symbol = 4 # for 16-QAM
block_length = 1024
model_uncoded_awgn = UncodedSystemAWGN(num_bits_per_symbol=num_bits_per_symbol, block_length=block_length)

# Assuming batch_size and ebno_db are given, the model can be called like this:
# bits, llr = model_uncoded_awgn(batch_size, ebno_db)
```

To run the simulation, you would also need to define `batch_size` and `ebno_db` appropriately. In the given context, these values are part of the simulation setup, but they would typically be specified based on the simulation's requirements. You can then call the model with specific values for `batch_size` and `ebno_db` to run the simulation.

Please note that because the context provided does not give exact usage or setup for 16-QAM specifically, adjustments might be needed if there are specific conventions or additional setup steps required in Sionna for this case.
