INSTRUCTION: Import the necessary Sionna library and configure GPU settings while preventing TensorFlow from displaying non-critical log messages.
ANSWER:To import the necessary Sionna library and configure GPU settings while preventing TensorFlow from displaying non-critical log messages, you can use the following code snippet. This code should be placed at the beginning of your Python script or Jupyter notebook.

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Set the GPU number to use
gpu_num = '0'  # set to '' to use the CPU instead of a GPU.

# Prevent TensorFlow from displaying non-critical log messages
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = gpu_num
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'  # 0 = all messages; 1 = INFO messages are not printed;
                                          # 2 = INFO and WARNING messages are not printed; 3 = INFO, WARNING, and ERROR messages are not printed

# Try to import Sionna. If not present, install it.
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError as e:
    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna

# Configure TensorFlow to use only the specified GPU and to grow memory usage as needed
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Memory growth must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

# Set TensorFlow logger to only display errors
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
```

This code snippet does the following:

1. Sets the GPU by its ID to be used for computation, or leaves it empty for CPU usage.
2. Configures the environment variable to control TensorFlow's logging level. It's set such that INFO (1), WARNING (2), and ERROR (3) messages are not printed.
3. Imports Sionna, installing the package if it's not already installed.
4. Configures TensorFlow to automatically grow the GPU memory usage as needed, which can be helpful to prevent TensorFlow from consuming all available GPU memory upfront.
5. Adjusts the TensorFlow logger's level to show only 'ERROR' messages to prevent spamming the output with non-critical log messages.
