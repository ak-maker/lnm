INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate how to initialize the `sionna.rt.Scene` class and load an example scene provided by the Sionna package.
ANSWER:To initialize the `sionna.rt.Scene` class and load an example scene provided by the Sionna package, you can follow these steps in Python, assuming you have already installed the Sionna package:

```python
import sionna
from sionna.rt import load_scene

# Load an example scene from the Sionna package.
# For example, using the Munich scene provided within Sionna's examples.
scene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)

# Now the `scene` object is an instance of sionna.rt.Scene class and is initialized and loaded with the Munich example scene.
# You can access scene elements and use methods provided by the Scene class.

# For example, you can preview the loaded scene if you are in a Jupyter notebook or similar interactive environment:
scene.preview()
```

Please note that you should use the appropriate example scene provided by Sionna's package in the `load_scene()` function. The example provided above uses the "munich" scene as an example, but you may need to reference the Sionna documentation or examples provided in the package to load other scenes that may be available to you.
