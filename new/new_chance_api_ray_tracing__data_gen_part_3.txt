INSTRUCTION: Explain the purpose of the `sionna.rt.Paths` class and demonstrate how to generate simulated propagation paths using the `compute_paths()` method.
ANSWER:The `sionna.rt.Paths` class in the Sionna Ray Tracing module is used for storing the simulated propagation paths in a radio propagation environment. These paths include information such as path coefficients, delays, angles of departure, and angles of arrival. Such data is critical when molding the way radio waves propagate from a transmitter to a receiver, considering different phenomenons like reflection, diffraction, or scattering. The `compute_paths()` method associated with the `Paths` class is used to calculate these propagation paths based on a loaded scene.

The use of `compute_paths()` typically involves setting up a scene with all the necessary components such as transmitters, receivers, and potentially objects that would interact with the propagating waves (buildings, trees, etc.). Each of these components will have their own properties that determine how waves propagate (e.g., antenna arrays, materials, etc.).

To demonstrate how to generate simulated propagation paths using the `compute_paths()` method, the following steps outline a generic usage pattern, which can be expanded and adapted as needed for specific applications.

```python
import sionna
from sionna.rt import Paths, load_scene

# Load a predefined scene, which comes with the Sionna framework (e.g., a city model)
scene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.munich)

# Typically, you would configure antenna arrays for the transmitters and receivers in the scene:
# e.g., for transmitters
scene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=8, num_cols=2, vertical_spacing=0.7, horizontal_spacing=0.5)

# e.g., for receivers
scene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1, num_cols=1, vertical_spacing=0.5, horizontal_spacing=0.5)

# After setting up transmitters, receivers, and other parameters, compute the propagation paths
paths = scene.compute_paths()

# You can further process the paths, for example, to compute channel impulse responses (CIRs),
# which might be used in link-level simulations:
a, tau = paths.cir()

# Optionally, you could apply Doppler shifts if your scenario involves movement
# using paths.apply_doppler(sampling_frequency, num_time_steps, tx_velocities, rx_velocities)
```

In the above snippet, replace `PlanarArray` with appropriate configurations for antenna arrays, and set any other necessary parameters specific to your scene and application requirements. The `scene.compute_paths()` call is the key step that generates the propagation paths after setting all the scene parameters.

Remember that the actual configurations for the scene, antenna arrays, and other parameters may vary depending on the specifics of the radio environment you intend to simulate and the assumptions you are making about the propagation conditions.
