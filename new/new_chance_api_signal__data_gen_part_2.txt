INSTRUCTION: Demonstrate how to create a Hann window using sionna.signal.HannWindow and apply it to a signal.
ANSWER:To demonstrate creating a Hann window using `sionna.signal.HannWindow` in Python and applying it to a signal, follow these steps:

1. First, import the necessary module and create a signal that you want to window.
2. Instantiate a `HannWindow` with the desired length.
3. Apply the window to the signal by element-wise multiplying the window coefficients with the signal.
4. (Optional) Plot the original and windowed signals to visualize the effect of the window.

Here is a code example in Python using TensorFlow and Sionna library:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna

# Assume Sionna and TensorFlow are already installed and imported
# Import the HannWindow class from the sionna.signal module
from sionna.signal import HannWindow

# Create a dummy signal
signal_length = 1024
frequency = 5
sample_rate = 100
t = np.linspace(0, signal_length / sample_rate, signal_length, endpoint=False)
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * frequency * t)

# Plot the original signal
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, signal, label='Original Signal')
plt.legend()

# Create a Hann window of the same length as the signal
window_length = signal_length
hann_window = HannWindow(window_length)

# Apply the window to the signal
# The signal needs to be cast into a TensorFlow tensor and expanded to match the dimensions expected by the HannWindow layer
signal_tensor = tf.constant(signal, dtype=tf.float32)
signal_tensor = tf.expand_dims(signal_tensor, axis=0)  # Expand dimensions to match the layer's requirements

# Apply the window by element-wise multiplication
windowed_signal_tensor = hann_window(signal_tensor)

# Convert the result back to a numpy array for plotting
windowed_signal = windowed_signal_tensor.numpy().flatten()

# Plot the windowed signal
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, windowed_signal, label='Windowed Signal')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This example creates a simple sinusoidal signal and applies a Hann window to it. The `HannWindow` class is used to generate the window coefficients and apply them to the signal. The final result shows both the original and the windowed signals, where you can observe the effect of the Hann window, typically a smooth tapering off at both ends.

INSTRUCTION: Explain the process of creating a filter with a Blackman window and normalizing it using sionna.signal.Filter.
ANSWER:To create a filter using the Blackman window and normalize it using `sionna.signal.Filter`, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Filter Parameters**: Decide the filter's span in symbols (`span_in_symbols`) and the number of samples per symbol (`samples_per_symbol`). These parameters define the length of the filter, which is `span_in_symbols * samples_per_symbol`. If this product is even, a value of one will be added to make the length odd.

2. **Instantiate the Blackman Window**: Use `sionna.signal.BlackmanWindow` class with the desired length. You will have to set the `normalize` parameter to `True` if you want the Blackman window to have unit average power per coefficient, but note that in the `Filter` class, normalization happens after windowing, so normalizing the Blackman window is not strictly necessary.

3. **Create the Filter with the Blackman Window**: Instantiate a `Filter` object by passing the span in symbols, samples per symbol, and the instantiated Blackman window into the constructor. Set the `normalize` parameter to `True` to automatically normalize the filter coefficients to have unit power.

Here's a code example to demonstrate these steps:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna

# Step 1: Determine the filter parameters
span_in_symbols = 32  # Set the filter span in symbols
samples_per_symbol = 4  # Set the oversampling factor

# Step 2: Instantiate the Blackman window
blackman_window = sionna.signal.BlackmanWindow(span_in_symbols * samples_per_symbol, normalize=False)

# Step 3: Create and normalize the filter with the Blackman window
blackman_filter = sionna.signal.Filter(span_in_symbols,
                                       samples_per_symbol,
                                       window=blackman_window,
                                       normalize=True)  # Ensure the filter coefficients are normalized to have unit power.

# Now the blackman_filter object can be used to filter input signals.
```

Make sure you have `sionna` installed and properly set up in your working environment to run the above code. The provided code uses TensorFlow, upon which Sionna is built, for generating and processing signals with the defined filter.

INSTRUCTION: Show how to perform upsampling on a given signal using sionna.signal.Upsampling.
ANSWER:To perform upsampling on a given signal using the `sionna.signal.Upsampling` class, follow these steps:

1. First, import the necessary module from the Sionna library and any other required libraries, such as TensorFlow.

2. Create an instance of the `sionna.signal.Upsampling` class by passing the desired upsampling factor `samples_per_symbol` and specifying the axis along which to upsample.

3. Call this instance with the signal you want to upsample.

Here is Python code that demonstrates these steps:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sionna

# Given signal (Example signal for illustration purposes)
# Assume 'x' is your signal tensor of shape [..., N] where N is the number of samples
x = tf.random.uniform(shape=[128, 1000])  # Example signal with batch size 128 and 1000 samples

# Upsampling parameters
samples_per_symbol = 4  # Upsampling factor (number of samples per symbol after upsampling)

# Create an instance of the Upsampling class
us = sionna.signal.Upsampling(samples_per_symbol)

# Perform upsampling on the signal 'x'
x_us = us(x)

# The signal 'x_us' is now the upsampled signal
```

Please replace the example signal `x` with your own signal you want to upsample.

After performing these steps, `x_us` will be the upsampled version of the original signal `x`, with each sample followed by `samples_per_symbol - 1` zeros along the specified axis.
